The transportation efficiency metrics illustrate distinct patterns across different transportation modes. For the "people ship," metrics start at moderate values but decline significantly and then stabilize at lower levels, showing an overall decreasing trend. The "get Cargo ship" experiences fluctuations with a sharp initial decline followed by a steady rise to peak values, indicating recovery and growth after initial setbacks. The "happy train" demonstrates low initial metrics, followed by significant growth and stabilization at moderate levels. The data reveal that while the "get Cargo ship" achieves the highest maximum values, indicating efficiency improvements, the "people ship" requires further optimization due to declining performance. These trends suggest a need for strategic adjustments across different transport methods to enhance overall efficiency.
