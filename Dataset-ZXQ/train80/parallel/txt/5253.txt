The analysis of the influence metrics across different cultural categories reveals substantial variability. The "likely Civilization" consistently maintains high values, peaking in the behavior change rate. In contrast, "necessary Civilization" experiences the most notable fluctuations, demonstrating a significant decline before sharply increasing in language adoption. Overall, there's a mix of increasing and decreasing trends across the metrics, with no clear linear growth. Key turning points include the sharp rise of "necessary Civilization" in language adoption and the steady decline of "likely Civilization" in media coverage and cultural citations. These variations indicate diverse influence dynamics across cultural dimensions.
