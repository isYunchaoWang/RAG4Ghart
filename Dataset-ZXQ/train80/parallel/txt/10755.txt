The analysis of the property characteristics across different house types reveals varied patterns. The key metrics indicate diverse maximum and minimum values across categories like energy efficiency, bedroom count, days on market, walk score, and bathroom count. Overall trends in the data show fluctuating patterns rather than consistent increases or decreases. Notably, there is significant variability in the walk score and bathroom count metrics, with some properties exhibiting prominent growth or decline. These shifts suggest that while certain characteristics like energy efficiency and bedroom count remain relatively stable, others are subject to considerable change, indicating diverse market appeals and preferences.
