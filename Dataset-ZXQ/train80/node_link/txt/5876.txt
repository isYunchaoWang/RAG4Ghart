The network graph of interconnected housing projects consists of 12 nodes connected by 15 edges. These nodes represent different housing projects categorized by five relation types: Broker Affiliation, Lease Chain, Property Exchange, Real Estate Agency Link, and Rental Agreement. The graph is fully connected, meaning all projects are part of a single component, ensuring potential collaboration or transactions between any two nodes. Degree centrality analysis identifies the most influential nodes in the network as Riverstone Residences, Pinehill Townhomes, and Sunset Villas Complex, each serving as key hubs with multiple connections. These findings highlight the strategic importance of these central nodes in facilitating interactions across the housing projects network.
