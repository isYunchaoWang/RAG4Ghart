The analyzed network chart illustrates the interactions between six departments through four types of relations: Department Collaboration, Employee Transfer, Internal Referral, and Project Allocation. The graph is fully connected, indicating that there are no isolated departments and all nodes (departments) are part of a single component. Each department is interconnected with multiple relations, symbolizing a complex web of interactions. The key influential nodes, based on degree centrality, include the Department of Public Health, Department of Environmental Safety, and Department of Cybersecurity, each maintaining the highest number of connections. This reflects a well-integrated network where these departments play crucial roles in facilitating interactions across the organization.
