The analysis of the Regional Tourist Flow Connections graph reveals a network comprising 9 nodes connected by 11 edges, categorizing relationships into various types such as hotel chain memberships, shared transport, sightseeing bus connections, tour routes, and tourism package links. The graph is not fully connected, consisting of two distinct components: one major interconnected cluster and a single isolated node, the Beijing Forbidden Site. Within the primary cluster, the Kyoto Temple Area emerges as the most influential node, exhibiting the highest degree centrality with a total of five connections. This is followed by New York City Landmark and Paris Historical Spot, both with four connections, indicating their significance in facilitating tourist flow. This analysis highlights key hubs and connectivity patterns crucial for understanding regional tourism dynamics.
