The interconnected housing projects network consists of 11 nodes and 12 edges, categorized by five distinct relation types. This graph is divided into two disconnected components, indicating a partially connected network. The main component comprises ten nodes, including notable entities like Sunset Villas Complex, which serves as a key connectivity hub linking multiple estates. The secondary component is a single isolated node, Hilltop Luxury Condos, connected by a broker affiliation. Degree centrality analysis reveals Sunset Villas Complex, Oceanfront Horizon Estate, and Riverstone Residences as the most influential hubs, with 4, 3, and 3 connections respectively. These findings highlight the essential role of specific nodes in maintaining the network's structural integrity and the relative isolation of certain entities.
