The network is fully connected, meaning all institutions interact within a single component. Degree centrality analysis identifies three highly influential hubs: the Global Culture Pavilion, Urban Theater House, and Folklore Exhibition Hall, each with the highest number of connections. These key nodes play significant roles in facilitating cross-cultural events and collaborations, contributing to a robust network of cultural exchange.
