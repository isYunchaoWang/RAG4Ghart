The graph illustrating interconnected housing projects reveals a total of 11 nodes with 12 edges, representing various relational ties among housing regions. The nodes are connected through four types of relationships: Broker Affiliation, Lease Chain, Real Estate Agency Link, and Rental Agreement. The network is not fully connected, consisting of two distinct components. The larger component includes most housing projects, indicating a densely interconnected sub-network, while a smaller, separate connection exists between Golden Terrace Apartments and Maplewood Park Homes. Key influential nodes include the central junctures Harborview Condominiums, Sunset Villas Complex, and Crystal Bay Residence, each displaying the highest degree centrality. This configuration highlights the pivotal roles these projects play in maintaining the cohesion of the larger component.
