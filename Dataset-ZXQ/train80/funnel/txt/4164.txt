The energy generation and distribution funnel chart reveals a clear descending staircase trend from initial generation to final consumption. The maximum energy value is 87,374 MWh at post-generation, while the minimum is 16,435 MWh at paid consumption. The total energy documented throughout the stages is 229,755 MWh, with an average of 38,292.5 MWh. There is a notable decrease in energy at each stage, highlighting significant losses during transmission and distribution. The sharpest decline occurs between post-generation and post-transmission stages, marking critical efficiency challenges. This analysis underscores the need for improved efficiency in the energy distribution process to minimize losses and enhance overall system performance.
