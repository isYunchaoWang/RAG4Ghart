The freight logistics order processing funnel illustrates a sequential decrease in shipments through each stage. Starting with 3,383 shipments booked for transport, there is a noticeable drop as the process progresses, with only 422 shipments resulting in feedback or a rating. The average decline across stages indicates significant attrition, particularly between booking services and preparing for pickup, as well as between beginning transportation and completing delivery. The shape of the funnel reveals a non-linear decline, highlighting potential inefficiencies in the process where improvements could be targeted, especially in the transition from bookings to service execution.
