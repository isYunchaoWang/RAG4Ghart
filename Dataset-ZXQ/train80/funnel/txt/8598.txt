The Real Estate Sales Process chart illustrates a funnel with data points indicating a steady decline as properties move through each stage from "Property Viewed" to "Post-sale Survey." Starting with 713 properties viewed, the numbers dwindle through subsequent stages: negotiation (475), contract signing (360), to sales closed (273), ultimately finishing with 228 in the post-sale survey. This steady decrease signifies a linear attrition at each stage, indicating a consistent drop-off at every phase of the sales process without significant fluctuations or turning points.
