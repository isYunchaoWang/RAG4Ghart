The "Engineering Project Lifecycle" chart efficiently illustrates a structured downward trend in project completion percentages across six key stages. Beginning with "Project Initiation" at 100%, there is a consistent decline through each phase, culminating in "Production" at 19%. The most pronounced drop occurs between "Final Design Approval" and "Production." The overall trend displays a linear decrease, reflecting standard project workflows where the number of projects typically narrows as they progress through subsequent phases. No significant outliers or unexpected variations are observed.
