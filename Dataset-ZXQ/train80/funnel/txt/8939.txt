The real estate sales process depicted in the chart shows a clear funnel effect, where the number of properties progresses through distinct stages from "Negotiation" to "Post-sale Survey." Initially, there are 371 properties in the negotiation stage, reducing significantly to 185 at the contract signing stage, indicating a steep drop-off. The trend continues with further declines to 76 at the sale closed stage and finally to 67 at the post-sale survey stage. This indicates a consistent decreasing trend throughout the process, characterized by sequential attrition at each phase. No significant positive growth or turning points are visible. The analysis suggests a need to investigate potential bottlenecks, particularly the substantial decline from negotiation to contract signing, to improve conversion rates.
