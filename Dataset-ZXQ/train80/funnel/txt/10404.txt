The Engineering Project Lifecycle chart exhibits a gradually decreasing trend from Project Initiation at 100% to Production at 22%. The decline shows a consistent, linear reduction at each stage, with notable drops during the Design to Production phases. The most significant decrease occurs between Testing and Validation (51%) and Final Design Approval (35%). This pattern highlights a clear funnel structure, indicative of typical project lifecycle progression, where attrition is expected as the project advances towards completion.
