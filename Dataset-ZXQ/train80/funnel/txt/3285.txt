The data on online learning progression shows a clear decreasing trend, starting from a 100% engagement rate at browsing course pages to a 20% completion rate for earning a certificate. There is a gradual decline at each step, with noticeable drops between browsing and registration activities, as well as between the completion of assignments and passing the final test. The largest reduction in engagement occurs between passing the final test and earning a certificate, indicating potential barriers at the final stages of course completion. Overall, the pattern reveals significant drop-offs that suggest a need for interventions to maintain participant engagement throughout the learning process.
