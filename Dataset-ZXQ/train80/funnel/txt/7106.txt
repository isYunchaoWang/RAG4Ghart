The employee recruitment funnel shows a progressive narrowing from HR interviews to offers accepted. Maximum participation is seen at the HR Interview stage (100%), with the smallest percentage at Offer Accepted (22%). The data reveals a downward trend, as candidates proceed through the recruitment process, with significant reductions at each stage. The largest drop is observed from Technical Interviews to Offers Extended (a 28% decrease), and the overall acceptance rate is fairly low. This pattern highlights potential areas for improvement in candidate retention between the interview stages and ultimately improving offer acceptance rates.
