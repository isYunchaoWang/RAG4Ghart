The beverage sales process displays a funnel trend, with the initial stage of taste testing reaching 1,486 thousand bottles and progressively narrowing to 431 thousand bottles at the repeat purchase stage. The maximum value occurs at the taste testing phase (1,486), while the minimum value occurs in the repeat purchase phase (431). The overall pattern shows a decreasing trend, beginning with high engagement at taste testing, followed by significant drop-offs at each subsequent phase. The transition between each stage, especially from market launch to retail placement and in-store promotion to actual customer purchases, indicates substantial attrition. Understanding and addressing the reasons for these drop-offs could present opportunities for process improvement and increased sales efficiency.
