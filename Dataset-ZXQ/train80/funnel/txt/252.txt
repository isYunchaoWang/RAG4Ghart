The agricultural supply chain shows a clear decreasing trend from post-processing to delivery to retail, with a noticeable funnel shape characteristic of losses or reductions at each stage. Starting with a maximum of 15,703 tons post-processing, the quantity decreases to 7,851 tons after quality inspection, reduces further to 3,258 tons when packaged, and ends with 2,877 tons delivered to retail. This illustrates a diminishing quantity through each phase, reflecting either processing losses, rejections in quality checks, or inefficiencies in packaging and delivery. The most significant drop occurs between post-processing and quality inspection, indicating potential issues in maintaining initial output quality. While each stage experiences shrinkage, the overall linear decline underscores room for improvement to enhance efficiency and minimize losses throughout the supply chain.
