The Agricultural Supply Chain funnel chart showcases a clear decreasing trend in tonnage from post-processing to consumer purchase. Starting at 16,612 tons at the post-processing stage, the volume reduces sequentially through each phase, ending at 2,337 tons purchased by consumers. The significant reductions between stages highlight potential bottlenecks or losses, particularly noticeable between packaging for distribution and delivery to retail, which might indicate a critical area for process optimization. Overall, the chart reflects a linear decrease, emphasizing the need for strategies to minimize losses and improve efficiency throughout the supply chain.
