The data on sports event participation reveals a step-wise decline from event attendance to event reattendance. Starting with a maximum attendance of 1,220, the numbers gradually drop through stages of engagement and feedback, reaching a minimum of 320 for reattendance. The overall trend demonstrates a consistent decrease, suggesting that while initial attendance is high, subsequent interactions and engagements significantly taper off. This implies a need for strategies to enhance post-event involvement and encourage repeat participation.
