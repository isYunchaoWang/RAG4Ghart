The Freight Logistics Order Processing chart illustrates a sequential decline in shipments at each stage of the process, starting from 4,139 thousand shipments as transport options are searched, down to 661 thousand shipments when delivery is completed. This data reflects a clear and consistent decreasing trend, indicative of a funnel shape often observed in process attrition. The most significant drop occurs between the "Search Transport Options" and "Select Carrier or Service" stages, with a decrease of 1,602 thousand shipments, representing the highest attrition point in the process at approximately a 39% reduction. The trend follows a linear decline, signaling issues or inefficiencies that could be addressed to reduce shipment drop-off at various stages. Overall, increasing efficiency in selection and booking stages may improve the progression of shipments through to completion.
