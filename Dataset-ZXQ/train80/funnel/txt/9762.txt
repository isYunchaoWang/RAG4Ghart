The analysis of the e-commerce user purchase funnel highlights a substantial drop-off at each stage, with a starting point of 9,024 users viewing advertisements and reducing to 1,147 entering payment information. The maximum value occurs at the advertisement stage, while the minimum is during payment entry. This showcases an overall decreasing trend typical of conversion funnels, with diminishing user engagement at each step. Notably, the most significant drop-offs occur between viewing the product page and adding items to the cart. Enhancements in user experience and targeted strategies at these critical stages could potentially improve conversion efficiency.
