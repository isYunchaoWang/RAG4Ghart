The data from the tourist booking and travel funnel shows a decreasing trend as the process advances from searching travel packages to leaving reviews. Initially, 1063 thousand tourists search for travel packages. This number decreases through each subsequent stage, with only 213 thousand leaving reviews. The largest decline occurs between "Search Travel Packages" and "Select Accommodation," involving a reduction of 153 thousand tourists. The average number of tourists across all stages is 605.71 thousand. Although the process shows a consistent linear decline with no significant turning points, the data highlights the importance of optimizing early stages, as a considerable number of tourists drop off before completing their journey.
