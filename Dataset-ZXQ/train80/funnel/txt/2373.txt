The funnel chart for cultural artwork exhibitions demonstrates a progressive and consistent decrease in the percentage of artworks as they advance through each stage of the process. Starting with 100% of artworks created, there is a significant drop to 66% submitted for review, followed by successive declines to 41% approved for exhibition and further down to 12% institutionally acquired. This trend indicates a funneling effect common in selection processes, with a notable decrease between each phase. The highest drop occurs between artworks created and submitted for review, highlighting a critical point of filtering. Overall, the data suggests an efficient weeding out of artworks, culminating in a select few being institutionally acquired.
