The Agricultural Supply Chain funnel reflects a stepwise decrease in tonnage from total harvested crop to consumer purchase. Initially, 13,364 tons are harvested, and the journey culminates with 2,033 tons purchased by consumers. The maximum value occurs at the harvesting stage, while the minimum is at the consumer purchase stage. Notably, there is a considerable reduction post-harvest, dropping to 8,603 tons, with further decreases after processing and quality inspection stages. Overall, the trend is decreasing at each stage, indicating a steady reduction primarily due to processing and quality scrutiny. The sharpest decrease occurs between the harvest and post-harvest stages, emphasizing the importance of minimizing losses in the early supply chain phases to maximize consumer availability.
