The employee recruitment funnel shows a progressive decrease in candidate retention through each stage, beginning with 100% of job postings viewed and narrowing down to 12% receiving an offer. The maximum value is 100% at the "Job Posting Viewed" stage, and the minimum is 12% at "Offer Extended." This funnel illustrates a declining trend, which is expected in recruitment processes, indicative of a high drop-off rate at each step. The largest drop is observed from "Application Submitted" (61%) to "Phone Screen" (38%), highlighting a significant bottleneck. The trend suggests a potential need to investigate improvements at earlier stages, such as application and screening processes, to enhance retention and efficiency.
