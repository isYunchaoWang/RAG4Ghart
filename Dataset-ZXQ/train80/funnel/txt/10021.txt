The Engineering Project Lifecycle chart reveals a significant attrition throughout its stages. Beginning with 100% in Prototype Development, the percentages decrease to 55% for Testing and Validation, 33% for Final Design Approval, and finally 27% by Production. The maximum value is observed at the starting phase, while the Production phase holds the minimum. The overall trend is a linear decrease, indicating substantial drop-offs at each stage. The most substantial decrease occurs between Prototype Development and Testing and Validation, showing the highest transition loss. The data reflect critical points where resources might be optimized to improve progression through the lifecycle.
