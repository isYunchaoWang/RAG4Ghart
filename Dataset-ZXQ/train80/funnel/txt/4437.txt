The energy flow from generation to billed consumption shows a significant decrease, indicating substantial losses at each stage of the distribution process. Starting from a total energy generation of 72,635 MWh, only 7,738 MWh is finally billed to consumers. The largest drop occurs post-generation, with nearly 28,100 MWh lost during generation and another considerable reduction during transmission. The data reveals a clear downward trend, highlighting inefficiencies that could be critical for strategic improvements in energy delivery systems.
