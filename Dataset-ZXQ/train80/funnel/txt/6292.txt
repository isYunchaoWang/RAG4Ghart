The patient referral flow chart illustrates a decreasing trend from initial consultation to treatment completion, indicating a consistent drop-off at each stage. Starting with 4,738 initial consultations, only 1,235 patients complete their treatment. The maximum volume occurs at the initial consultation, while the minimum is at treatment completion. The number of patients decreases sharply between each stage, notably from diagnosis confirmation to treatment recommendation. There are no upward trends or growth events, as the flow appears linear and consistently declining. This suggests potential challenges in patient retention or process inefficiencies throughout the referral process.
