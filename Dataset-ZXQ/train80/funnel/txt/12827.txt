The analysis of the sports event participation funnel reveals a decreasing trend from the initial announcement to post-event feedback. The maximum participation is observed at the event announcement stage with 1,047 participants, while the minimum is at the post-event feedback stage with 161 participants. Overall, the funnel demonstrates a consistent reduction at each stage: ticket purchases drop to 596, event attendance further reduces to 332, followed by 190 in fan engagement. The total participant count through the stages sums up to 2,326, with an average of 465 per stage. Significant decreases are evident at each transition, indicating substantial attrition throughout the process. This emphasizes the need for enhanced engagement strategies to maintain participant interest and reduce drop-off rates from announcement to feedback.
