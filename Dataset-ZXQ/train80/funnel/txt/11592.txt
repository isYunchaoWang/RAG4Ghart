The social media engagement funnel demonstrates a significant decline in user participation as the activity level becomes more involved. With a maximum of 283 million users sharing content and a minimum of 49 million engaged in content creation or upload, the average engagement across activities is approximately 127.75 million users. The overall trend displays a sharp decrease through each engagement phase, suggesting that while many users participate in sharing content, fewer engage in more involved activities like joining groups or creating content. Identifying turning points, the most noteworthy drop occurs between sharing content and following accounts, indicating a potential area for targeted strategies to retain user engagement at higher levels.
