The beverage sales process shows a declining trend from the initial product concept stage to customer purchase. Beginning with 4,885 thousand bottles at product concept, the numbers progressively decrease through each subsequent stage, ending at 1,229 thousand bottles for customer purchase. This indicates a conversion funnel where attrition occurs at each stage, with the most significant drop from in-store promotion to customer purchase, highlighting areas for potential improvement in marketing and sales conversion strategies. Overall, the data suggest a need for focused efforts to enhance customer engagement and sales effectiveness, particularly in the later stages of the funnel.
