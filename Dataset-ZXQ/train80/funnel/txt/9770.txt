The chart illustrates the e-commerce user purchase funnel, showcasing a sequential drop in user engagement at each stage. Starting with 7,417 users viewing advertisements, there is a decrease through each step, down to 956 users completing a purchase. The maximum value is for advertisement views (7,417), while the minimum is for completed purchases (956). The total across all stages sums up to 29,642, averaging 4,234 users per stage.

Overall, the trend reflects a typical funnel shape with consistent attrition as users progress through the steps. The decline appears uniform, without sharp fluctuations, indicating a stable decrease rather than a marked drop at any single stage.

The most significant reduction occurs between viewing advertisements and product page visits, highlighting a critical conversion area. No abrupt turning points are evident, suggesting a need for strategic interventions to improve retention and conversion at each step.
