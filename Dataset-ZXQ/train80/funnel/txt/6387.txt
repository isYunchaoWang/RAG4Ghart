The patient referral flow chart indicates a significant decrease at each stage of the process from diagnosis confirmation to treatment completion. The maximum value is at the diagnosis confirmed stage with 2,252 patients, and the minimum is at treatment completion with 416 patients. The overall trend displays a sharp decline throughout the funnel, highlighting considerable drop-offs at each step. Notable reductions occur from treatment recommended (1,126) to treatment initiated (467), marking the highest growth in percentage decrease of 58.5%. There are no upward turning points detected within this funnel. This suggests potential inefficiencies or barriers between initial diagnosis and treatment completion that need to be addressed to improve patient retention and care outcomes.
