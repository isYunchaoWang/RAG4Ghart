The online learning progression funnel indicates significant attrition at each stage of the process. Starting with a registration rate of 100%, the percentage of learners decreases steadily to 61% for course registration and falls sharply thereafter, with only 16% ultimately earning a certificate. While the largest dropout occurs between course registration and completing the first lesson, the most consistent decrease is observed in subsequent steps. This trend highlights critical engagement challenges in moving learners through the stages, suggesting a need for targeted interventions to enhance user retention and completion rates.
