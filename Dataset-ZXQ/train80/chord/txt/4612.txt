The circular chart illustrates the energy production and consumption flow in gigawatt-hours from three sources: Nuclear, Hydropower, and Biomass. Nuclear energy shows the highest production, peaking at around 330 gigawatt-hours, followed by Hydropower at approximately 550 gigawatt-hours and Biomass at roughly 110 gigawatt-hours. The overall trend is stable with no significant fluctuations or growth patterns, except for a steady consumption flow connecting the sources. This indicates balanced utilization of energy production from each source, without prominent growth events or turning points.
