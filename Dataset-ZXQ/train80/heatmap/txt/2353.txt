The analysis of the correlations between various educational roles and academic fields reveals distinct patterns. Admin roles exhibit the highest correlation across fields, ranging from 0.71 to 0.75, indicating strong associations. The Faculty group follows with moderate correlation values, primarily between 0.60 and 0.65. In stark contrast, the lowest correlations are observed in the Sophomore and Staff categories, demonstrating minimal connections across disciplines. Overall, while correlation levels vary, Admin roles consistently show the strongest relationships, suggesting an impactful link between administrative positions and academic fields. No significant turning points are evident, as the correlations across categories maintain relative stability.
