The data illustrate the distribution of real estate transactions across location types, financing options, and property types. The most significant activity occurs in rural areas, particularly through lease-to-own financing, with multi-family units being the most common property type. Mortgage financing dominates urban transactions, focusing on single-family homes and commercial properties. The highest numbers are observed in rural lease-to-own multi-family transactions. The overall trend indicates a preference for lease-to-own in rural areas and mortgage options in urban areas, with no significant turning points noted in the structure of transactions across these categorizations.
