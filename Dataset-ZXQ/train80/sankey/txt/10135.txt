Private investment is the largest funding source, with a total of 355 projects. The University budget follows, funneling a significant number of projects towards published papers and open-source projects. 

Commercial products and open-source projects are key outcomes, receiving substantial input from different funding sources, particularly in the areas of environment and industrial automation. The distribution suggests a balance across impact areas, with neither sharply dominating. Corporate labs and non-profit organizations are prominent recipients of these projects, indicating a collaboration between commercial and altruistic objectives.

The overall trend shows a robust flow towards industrial and educational advancements. Though there is no clear peak in terms of growth or drastic changes, continuous engagement in these areas reflects a stable and consistent trend in R&D project priorities, supporting a diverse range of institutions.
