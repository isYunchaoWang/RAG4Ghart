The manufacturing supply transportation chain displays a complex flow of goods from assembly through distribution centers to various retail outlets. The maximum flow value observed is 756 units from the Express Sorting Center to the Convenience Store, while the minimum is 37 units stemming from Quality Check to South Hub. Overall, the distribution demonstrates a mix of larger and smaller quantities distributed across multiple pathways, indicating a decentralized supply chain. The trend does not follow a simple linear pattern but reflects significant variations with multiple distribution channels. The data does not specify any single turning point, suggesting a stable multipath distribution with notable larger transactions primarily funneled through major centers like the Express Sorting Center. The pathways display a diverse spread of resource allocation across retail points, suggesting a comprehensive approach to catering to diverse consumer needs effectively.
