The data on the real estate transaction ecosystem indicates a varied distribution across different property types, locations, and market conditions. Condos dominate the property type category with the highest count of 252, while single-family homes and multi-family units show significantly lower numbers. The suburban location type sees the most transactions, particularly notable with townhouses. In terms of market conditions, the neutral market accommodates the highest number of transactions, especially in urban areas. Despite minor fluctuations, the overall trend does not exhibit a dramatic increase or decrease, suggesting a fairly balanced real estate landscape with minor surges in suburban condo transactions under seller's market conditions.
