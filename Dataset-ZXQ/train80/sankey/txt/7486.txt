The Employee Management System chart reveals several insights into the onboarding and interview processes leading to employee performance ratings. The maximum flow of employees is observed in the technical interview stage with 3,840 employees, while the fewest belong to the document verification stage, at 445 employees. The total number of individuals across the stages sums up to 12,149. On average, each process stage involves around 2,430 employees.

Overall, the trend shows a significant concentration of employees progressing from the onboarding to the technical interview, indicating a potential bottleneck at this stage. The data illustrates a clear pathway with linear growth up to the technical interview, followed by distribution into performance categories.

This analysis highlights a significant transition point from the interview stages to performance ratings, suggesting that performance assessment following the technical interview results in a substantial portion of employees achieving a "Good" rating, whereas a parallel flow ends in "Below Average." Recognizing these trends can aid in optimizing the onboarding and interview processes to improve employee performance ratios.
