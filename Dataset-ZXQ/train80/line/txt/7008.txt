From 1961 to 1964, there was a divergent trend in technology adoption rates between the elderly population and rural communities. The technology adoption rate among rural communities displayed a consistent linear growth, increasing steadily year on year, from slightly above 10% in 1961 to nearly 14% by 1964. Conversely, the elderly population experienced initial fluctuations, with a noticeable dip to below 6% in 1962, followed by recovery and eventual notable growth, closing at approximately 6% by 1964. Despite the early volatility, a positive trend emerged for both groups by the end of the observed period, indicating an increasing overall acceptance of technology across different demographics. The data reflects key turning points in 1962 for the elderly population as the rate began to rebound, highlighting a potential increase in technology interest or access within the group.
