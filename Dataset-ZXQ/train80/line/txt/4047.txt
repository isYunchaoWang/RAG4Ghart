The hospital bed occupancy data from 1958 to 1974 reveals distinct trends across four hospitals. Initially, Azure Coast Hospital and Zenith Care Hospital show a declining occupancy trend until the mid-1960s, followed by a subsequent recovery leading to increased occupancy rates by 1974. Aethelgard General Hospital demonstrates a consistent upward trend, while Stellar Memorial Hospital gradually declines throughout the period. Notably, Zenith Care Hospital experiences the most significant fluctuations, diving to nearly zero occupancy around 1964 before rebounding sharply. These trends indicate varied hospital effectiveness and possible external influences impacting bed occupancy rates during these years.
