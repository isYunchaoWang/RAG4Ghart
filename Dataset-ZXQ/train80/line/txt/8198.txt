The streaming viewership data from 1982 to 1997 reveals clear performance distinctions among the six streaming services. AetherNet Sports displays the most significant growth, reaching a peak of over 600,000 views by 1997. The service's linear growth trajectory demonstrates its consistent increment without major fluctuations, marking it as the top performer. StarburstTV also exhibits robust growth, surpassing 400,000 views, but its trend includes initial fluctuations before consistent increment post-1990. Conversely, NovaStream Live shows a gradual decline and stabilizing trend at around 100,000 views, indicating decreasing popularity. OracleView and EchoWave Entertainment display intermediate performance with declining trends post-1990, reflecting a downturn in views. CrimsonCast, however, maintains stability around the 100,000 view mark, showing neither significant growth nor decline. These divergent trends underscore how different strategies and public interest can impact streaming viewership over time.
