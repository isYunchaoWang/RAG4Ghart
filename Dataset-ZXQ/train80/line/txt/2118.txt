The analysis of alumni giving rates from 1994 to 2020 for three organizations reveals diverse patterns in donation behavior. The Aethelgard Arts Circle experienced a dramatic increase from nearly 0% to 100%, indicating exponential growth particularly noticeable after 2006, where the growth rate accelerated sharply. This turning point marked a shift from linear growth to rapid expansion, culminating in a stable plateau at the maximum value. In contrast, the Zenith Tech Foundation demonstrated a consistent, gradual upward trend without significant fluctuations, maintaining stable growth until 2020. Lastly, the Silverhaven Polytechnic Fund displayed minimal variation, with its giving rate remaining largely unchanged, albeit with minor up-and-down fluctuations throughout the period. Overall, this analysis highlights the explosive growth of the Aethelgard Arts Circle, steady progress for the Zenith Tech Foundation, and stable trendline for the Silverhaven Polytechnic Fund, reflecting distinct donation dynamics and strategies across these entities.
