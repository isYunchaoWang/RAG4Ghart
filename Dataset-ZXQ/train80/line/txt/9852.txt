The analysis of driver satisfaction over the period from 1983 to 2009 reveals a significant fluctuation in the data. The satisfaction index initially declines from around 80 in 1983, reaching its lowest point at 20 in 1996, reflecting a period of substantial dissatisfaction. This is followed by a reversal in trend, with signs of steady recovery and growth from 1997 to 2009, as the satisfaction index climbs back to approximately 80. This trend suggests two distinct phases: a sharp decline over the first 13 years and a subsequent resurgence over the latter 13 years, indicating that significant improvements were made following a deep trough in satisfaction. The data suggests concerted efforts to address the reasons for declining satisfaction and successful initiatives to enhance driver satisfaction in the latter period.
