The analysis of hospital bed occupancy rates from 1973 to 1998 reveals distinct trends among the seven hospitals examined. Azure Coast Hospital maintained a consistent occupancy rate of 100%, indicating constant full capacity. Aethelgard General Hospital showed a stable trend at a high occupancy level, as did Borealis Medical Center but with gradual growth starting from a lower baseline. Stellar Memorial Hospital demonstrated consistent growth over the years, eventually reaching higher occupancy rates by 1998. Meridian Teaching Hospital displayed steady linear growth, steadily increasing its occupancy, mirroring Stellar Memorial but at a slightly lower pace. In contrast, Silverhaven Community Hospital experienced periodic fluctuations but overall maintained a gradual rise over time. Meanwhile, Zenith Care Hospital exhibited a significant decline in occupancy rates, starting high but dwindling to the lowest amongst the group by the end of the period. In summary, while some hospitals like Azure Coast and Aethelgard General maintained stable or growing high occupancy, others like Zenith Care reflected a distinct downward trend, each pattern highlighting unique operational dynamics and perhaps differing management strategies across these institutions.
