From 1984 to 2005, the Silverwood Forest and Golden Delta construction start trends showed distinctly opposite movements. Silverwood Forest experienced a steady increase in construction starts, progressing from approximately 450 units per year in 1984 to about 800 units in 2005. In contrast, Golden Delta experienced a notable decline during the same period, beginning at a similar rate to Silverwood Forest in 1984 but reducing to almost negligible levels by 2005. Specifically, the Golden Delta saw its most significant decrease during the late 1980s to 1990s. This analysis highlights a diverging trend where Silverwood Forest consistently grew in building starts, whereas Golden Delta rapidly declined to a stable low point, clearly indicating a shift in regional construction dynamics over the two decades.
