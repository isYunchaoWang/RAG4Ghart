Between 1996 and 2010, the average watch time among different user categories exhibited distinct trends. Mobile and free users generally demonstrated decreasing average watch times, though mobile users showed a slight rebound after 2005. In contrast, casual and new users presented strong growth, particularly highlighted by new users surpassing casual users in growth rate post-2003. The most significant growth can be observed in the casual user's watch time, which followed a linear upward trajectory. Meanwhile, new users' watch time also increased but at a slightly diminishing rate towards the end of the period. Overall, the period is characterized by contrasting usage patterns across user types, with mobile and free user watch time declining and stabilization, while casual and new users showed marked increases driven by growing engagement.
