From 1958 to 1985, the trend in restaurant reservations observed varied dynamics across different categories. Vegan Cafes showed a consistent increase in reservations, moving from lower figures in 1958 to becoming the leading category by 1985, demonstrating substantial linear growth. Street Food Hubs experienced a significant increase initially, peaking around 1973 before undergoing a decline, signaling a turning point and a shift from growth to reduction in patronage. In contrast, both Fusion Kitchens and Casual Eateries exhibited a declining trend over the timeframe, with Fusion Kitchens showing a steeper drop than Casual Eateries. Overall, this period was marked by an evolving preference towards Vegan Cafes as traditional options like Fusion Kitchens and Casual Eateries saw reduced popularity, while the once-popular Street Food Hubs could not sustain their early growth trajectory.
