The analysis of the Food Safety Index from 2001 to 2021 across three establishments¡ªStellar Bistro, Emerald Diner, and The Golden Spoon¡ªreveals a consistent upward trajectory for each. The Golden Spoon exhibits the largest increase, advancing from approximately an index of 100 in 2001 to just over 300 in 2021, indicating a significant gain in food safety measures. Emerald Diner follows with an increase from around 100 to over 200, while Stellar Bistro's growth is more modest, rising from an index near 100 to just below 200. Each establishment's growth trend is relatively linear with a steady pace, and no significant fluctuations or turning points are evident. This suggests that all three restaurants have progressively improved their food safety standards over the 20-year period, with The Golden Spoon leading in performance enhancements.
