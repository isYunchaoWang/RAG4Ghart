Over the period from 2004 to 2023, the research grants awarded to Nova Institute have shown a steady increase, demonstrating a linear growth pattern. Starburst College has experienced significant growth as well but at a more rapid pace, surpassing both Nova Institute and Aether University in grants numbers by 2023. Aether University, on the other hand, saw a decline in awarded grants until around 2014, after which a turning point led to a consistent recovery in grants awarded, eventually reaching similar levels as Nova Institute by the end of 2023. The highest growth rate observed was at Starburst College, particularly pronounced towards the latter part of the observed period. Overall, while Nova Institute and Starburst College were consistent in upward trends, Aether University demonstrated a notable rebound after initial declines.
