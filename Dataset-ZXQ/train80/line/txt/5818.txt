Analysis of the mortgage rate trends from 1980 to 2007 reveals distinct patterns across the companies. Notably, Emerald Capital shows a significant exponential growth in mortgage rates, peaking dramatically in 2007 at approximately 60%. In contrast, Aura Finance, Titan Lending, Apex Credit, and Horizon Funding display relatively stable and low mortgage rates throughout the period, with slight fluctuations. The substantial growth of Emerald Capital represents the highest growth rate amongst the companies, creating a marked divergence in market trends in the later years. This suggests disruptive market dynamics possibly influenced by external economic factors affecting Emerald Capital, while other companies maintained consistent rates. The clear turning point occurs post-1990, where Emerald Capital's rates rapidly increase, indicating potential strategic shifts or responses to macroeconomic conditions.
