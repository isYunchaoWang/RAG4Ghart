The data from 1979 to 2003 shows a distinct pattern in construction starts at Silverwood Forest, characterized by a steep decline followed by a gradual recovery, ultimately leading to a sharp increase in the early 2000s. Initially, there was a pronounced reduction in construction starts, decreasing from a high of nearly 450 units per year in 1979, bottoming out at approximately 150 units per year around 1987. During the subsequent years, construction starts exhibited modest fluctuations with a generally stable trajectory until the late 1990s. A significant turning point occurred after 1999, marked by a dramatic and consistent surge in construction starts, culminating in another peak reaching close to the maximum historical value observed by 2003. This trend highlights the recovery and growth phase in construction activities for the latter part of the period. Overall, the trajectory was downward initially, but post-1999, it showcased strong and accelerated growth.
