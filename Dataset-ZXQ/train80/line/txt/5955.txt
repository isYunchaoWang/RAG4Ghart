From 1955 to 1980, the Nova Exchange experienced a consistent and significant increase in home sales, reaching a peak of around 2400 units per month in 1980. This trend represents a steady and linear growth from approximately 1000 units in 1955. On the contrary, the Crimson Bazaar's home sales declined steadily from the same starting point as Nova Exchange in 1955 to zero by the early 1970s, where sales remained flat through 1980. The chart clearly portrays the divergent paths for these two entities: continuous growth for Nova Exchange and a gradual decline culminating in cessation for Crimson Bazaar.
