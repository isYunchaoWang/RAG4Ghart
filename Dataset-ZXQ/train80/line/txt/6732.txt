The technology adoption rate from 1978 to 1989 shows distinct trends across three groups: Rural Communities, Urban Dwellers, and Working Professionals. Rural Communities exhibit a steady, linear increase in adoption, culminating near 40% by 1989. Urban Dwellers reveal a slight decline from 1978, reaching a minimum around 1983-1984, followed by a gradual recovery peaking just above 10% at the end of the period. Working Professionals started with a low adoption rate, showing a consistent pattern near zero until significant growth began post-1988, pointing to a sudden increased engagement in the final phase. Identified turning points include Urban Dwellers' adoption rate recovery from 1985 and Working Professionals' notable growth in 1988-1989. Overall, the data highlights strong progressive adoption in Rural Communities and a late blooming interest among Working Professionals, contrasted by a variable yet recovering trend among Urban Dwellers.
