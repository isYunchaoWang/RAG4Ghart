From 1979 to 2000, the average room prices for different accommodation types showed varied trends. Ski Lodges started with higher prices but witnessed a steady decline until 1990, after which a slow upward trend emerged. City Center Hotels displayed consistent linear growth, suggesting rising popularity or increased demand in urban areas. Beachfront Villas experienced significant fluctuations, demonstrating peaks and troughs over the years, but ultimately displayed a moderate upward trend by the end of the period. Conversely, Treehouse Retreats experienced strong linear growth throughout the years, outpacing other accommodations in both maximum price and growth rate. The most significant growth was observed in Treehouse Retreats, with clear turning points where Beachfront Villas and Ski Lodges transition from declining or fluctuating trends to more stable or gradual increases. Overall, the accommodation industry saw increasing average room prices over 21 years, led prominently by the burgeoning Treehouse Retreats market.
