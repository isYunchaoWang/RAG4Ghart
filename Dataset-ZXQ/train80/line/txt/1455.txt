The theater attendance data from 1962 to 1972 shows notable fluctuations with key turning points. Initially, the attendance was high in 1962, then gradually declined, reaching its lowest point in 1968. From 1969 onwards, attendance showcased a significant upward trend, eventually approaching the attendance levels of the early 1960s by 1972. This trend suggests a U-shaped pattern in attendance over the ten-year period, with periods of decline followed by strong recovery and growth. The data indicates that while the early and final years of the period exhibit similar high attendance levels, the middle years experienced a dip in interest or participation, which was subsequently overcome leading to substantial growth in later years.
