The analysis reveals contrasting trends between Crimson Quill Publishing and Zenith Imprints over the years 1998 to 2014. Zenith Imprints demonstrated a clear bell-shaped curve, showing an initial rise in sales reaching peak levels around 2005, and subsequently experiencing a decline. This indicates an early growth phase followed by a gradual descent in sales figures, with no major turning points suggesting a steady decline post-2005. Conversely, Crimson Quill Publishing exhibits a cyclical pattern that fluctuates notably within a lower range, peaking consistently every few years. This cyclic behavior caused Crimson Quill Publishing's sales to vary significantly and intermittently rebound to higher values, particularly noticeable in the year 2014. While Zenith Imprints had a generally higher sales volume with gradual decline tendencies post-peak years, Crimson Quill Publishing maintained a dynamic and variable sale pattern, highlighting its resilience and potential adaptability within the fluctuating market conditions.
