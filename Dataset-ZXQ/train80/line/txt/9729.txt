The analysis of cargo shipment data from 1997 to 2019 reveals distinct trends in the logistics sector. Parcel Services demonstrated an initial increase in shipments, peaking around 2008, followed by a gradual decline towards 2019. Oceanic Carriers, on the other hand, showed a steady performance with a slight upward trend initially that levelled off around 2001 and remained relatively stable thereafter, with a slight decrease near the end of the period. Rail Networks experienced a notable decline initially but showed signs of recovery and growth after 2011, signaling a turning point. QuickShip Logistics showed a consistent decline in shipments over the entire time frame. The findings highlight shifts in logistics preferences and efficiencies over time, with Parcel Services peaking and then losing ground, Rail Networks rebounding after a decline, Oceanic Carriers maintaining a generally stable trajectory, and QuickShip Logistics experiencing a constant downturn. This suggests a dynamic logistics industry adjusting to shifting demands and challenges over the past two decades.
