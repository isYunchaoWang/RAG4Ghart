From 1974 to 1992, the average watch time for casual users displayed a consistent upward trend, marked by non-linear growth. Initial watch times were relatively modest at approximately 40 minutes per year in 1974, progressing to roughly 160 minutes by 1992. This period evidenced substantial escalation in viewing duration, with the largest incremental increase occurring towards the latter end of the timeframe, particularly post-1988, indicating accelerated viewer engagement. The growth trajectory was characterized by steady increases followed by a sharper incline, suggesting a turning point in viewing habits as technology and content offerings likely evolved. Overall, the data underscores a significant and continuous rise in media consumption over these years.
