The analysis reveals that engagement rates in relation to content length exhibit a U-shaped pattern. Engagement rates start high at shorter content lengths, decrease to their lowest point around 30 minutes, and then increase again towards longer durations. This indicates a preference for both shorter and longer content over medium-length content. The highest engagement rates are at the extremes of content length, suggesting that audience attention is captured most effectively at succinct and extended periods, likely due to varied content demands or viewing contexts.
