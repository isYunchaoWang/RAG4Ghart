The chart displays customer satisfaction ratings over checkout times. The data appears to fluctuate without a clear overall trend, indicating variability in customer satisfaction throughout checkout durations. There are noticeable variations in ratings at different times, although no significant turning points or consistent increases are evident. The scatter suggests that checkout time alone does not predict satisfaction levels reliably.
