The data illustrates that performance score increases with higher nutrition intake up to about 3000 calories per day, where it peaks at nearly 100. Post-peak, the performance score begins to decline as calorie consumption surpasses this level, demonstrating an inverse U-shaped trend. The most significant growth occurs from around 1000 to 3000 calories per day. This indicates that an optimal calorie intake exists for maximizing performance score, after which additional calories lead to diminishing returns. There is a clear turning point at the peak caloric intake, highlighting the importance of balanced nutrition in sports and fitness performance.
