The data shows a U-shaped relationship between pollution levels and glacier size. The maximum glacier size occurs at the lowest and highest pollution levels, while the minimum glacier size is observed at moderate pollution levels, indicating a potential turning point around these values. The trend suggests that glacier size decreases as pollution initially increases, reaching a low point, and then increases as pollution continues to rise. This pattern reveals an inverse correlation between moderate pollution levels and glacier size, highlighting significant environmental dynamics resulting from varying pollution impacts.
