The chart shows a U-shaped trend in absenteeism days per year relative to years of experience. Initially, absenteeism is high, reaching around 10 days with low experience but decreases to a minimum of approximately 1 day as experience increases, hitting the lowest point between 10 to 15 years. After this period, absenteeism gradually rises again, nearing its initial levels by 30 years of experience. The trend suggests that absenteeism decreases with experience initially but increases after reaching a pivotal mid-point, possibly indicating changes in job demands or personal circumstances over time.
