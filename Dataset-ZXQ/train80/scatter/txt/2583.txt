The water quality index displays a U-shaped trend as it relates to average temperature. It starts high at lower temperatures, declines to its minimum at mid-range temperatures, and then increases again at higher temperatures. This pattern suggests that water quality decreases as temperature rises to a midpoint, then improves as temperature continues to increase. No specific turning points or dramatic growth rates are evident, indicating a smooth, symmetrical trend. This implies potential temperature thresholds that impact water quality in environmental contexts.
