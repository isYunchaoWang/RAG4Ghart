The data illustrates a positive correlation between the amount of rainfall and air quality index. Starting from lower rainfall levels, the air quality index exhibits minor fluctuations but remains relatively low. As the rainfall amount increases, there is a noticeable upward trend in the air quality index, demonstrating a steep rise in later stages. The trend suggests a non-linear growth pattern, with significant improvements in air quality becoming apparent beyond the midpoint of the rainfall data range. This indicates that higher levels of rainfall are associated with substantially improved air quality.
