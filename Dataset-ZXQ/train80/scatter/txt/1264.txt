The data illustrates a nonlinear relationship between study hours and test scores, following an inverted U-shape pattern. Initially, as study hours increase, test scores rise, peaking around 20-25 hours of study per week. Beyond this point, additional study hours correlate with a decline in scores. The trend suggests that moderate study hours maximize academic performance, while excessive study may lead to diminishing returns. This highlights the significance of balanced study schedules to optimize educational outcomes.
