The data illustrates a generally decreasing trend in employee retention as team size increases. Beginning with high retention above 90% for smaller teams, it gradually declines to around 50% for larger teams. The trend implies a nonlinear decrease with occasional fluctuations, without specific turning points. This suggests that larger team sizes might be associated with lower retention rates, potentially signaling challenges in maintaining employee engagement or satisfaction in bigger teams.
