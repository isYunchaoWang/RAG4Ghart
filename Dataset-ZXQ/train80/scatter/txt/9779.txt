The provided scatter plot illustrates the relationship between distance traveled and fuel efficiency, showing no clear indication of a linear trend. Key metrics highlight a wide dispersion in fuel efficiency, ranging from 15 to 50 mpg across various distances. The data is scattered uniformly without a discernible pattern, suggesting a stable relationship overall. There are no significant events or turning points, indicating that the variability in fuel efficiency is not systematically related to distance traveled. Therefore, this analysis concludes that factors other than distance might influence fuel efficiency in transportation and logistics.
