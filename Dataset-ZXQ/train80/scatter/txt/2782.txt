The chart illustrates an inverse relationship between investment rates and interest rates, with investment rates generally decreasing as interest rates increase. Initially, there is a sharp decline in the investment rate from approximately 50% to below 20% as interest rates rise from 0% to about 4%. Post this decline, the investment rates demonstrate fluctuations but maintain a relatively stable pattern, ranging between 10% and 20% as the interest rates continue to climb towards 10%. No significant turning points or substantial growth phases are observed within the data range. The steep initial decline followed by stabilization suggests a typical response of investment behavior to rising interest rates.
