The chart data reveals a positive correlation between energy consumption and service cost, with both metrics demonstrating an increasing trend. The pattern is characterized by a steady growth with some fluctuations, suggesting a linear relationship. The maximum service cost is around $500 per month, while the minimum is approximately $100 per month. The trend does not display any significant turning points and appears consistent with a slight upward slope throughout. This indicates that higher energy consumption generally results in increased service costs, emphasizing a predictable cost structure as energy usage rises.
