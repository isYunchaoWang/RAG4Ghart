The chart indicates a clear negative correlation between fertilizer usage and soil quality. As fertilizer usage increases, soil quality tends to decrease, suggesting that higher fertilizer application adversely affects soil health. The trend is characterized by a fairly consistent downward slope, indicating a steady decrease in soil quality with increased fertilizer use. There are no significant turning points within the observed data, reinforcing a linear decline rather than fluctuation. This suggests a need for balanced fertilizer practices to maintain soil integrity.
