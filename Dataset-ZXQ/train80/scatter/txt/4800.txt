The analysis of marketing and sales data reveals that conversion rates initially increase with the email open rate, reaching a peak around the middle range, and then decline. This trend creates a parabolic shape, indicating that moderate email open rates are associated with optimal conversion performance. There is a significant growth in conversion rates as the open rates increase initially, followed by a peak and subsequent decrease. This suggests that beyond a certain point, further increases in open rates do not necessarily lead to higher conversions, indicating the presence of a turning point in the data.
