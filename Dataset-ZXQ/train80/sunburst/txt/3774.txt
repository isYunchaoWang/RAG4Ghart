In 2023, the food industry distribution exhibits a diverse allocation with aquaculture and freshwater farming, each constituting 53.2% of the overall distribution, leading all categories. This is followed by tilapia farming at 42.31%, making it a significant contributor within aquaculture. The average distribution across all categories is approximately 19.64%, indicating a concentrated distribution in the leading categories. A decreasing trend is observed from aquaculture to smaller segments like gelato (5.27%). Notable turning points include a significant drop from food processing (25.55%) to dairy processing (20.23%). This suggests that while the industry focuses heavily on aquaculture, there is diverse involvement in different stages of the food supply chain, from production to retail.
