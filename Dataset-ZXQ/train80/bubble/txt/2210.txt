The chart examines the relationship between artist popularity rank and commercial impact value, alongside the number of people involved. The commercial impact values range from 0.2 to 1.0, with the highest point at 1.0 ($100 million) at a low popularity rank and the lowest impact occurring around a mid-popularity rank. The average commercial value appears moderate, with significant variation. The pattern suggests a non-linear trend, with peaks and valleys, rather than a steady increase or decrease. Notable is the highest growth at the 1.0 commercial impact value, signifying a substantial influence despite lower popularity ranks. No direct linear trend suggests that high commercial impact can occur at various popularity levels, highlighting distinct turning points in artist influence.
