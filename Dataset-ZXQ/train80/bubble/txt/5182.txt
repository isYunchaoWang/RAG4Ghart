The analysis of the relationship between human resources and employee management reveals that the productivity index ranges from a low of approximately 50 to a high of around 160, with training hours spanning from 0 to 100 per year. The overall trend does not display a consistent linear pattern but rather fluctuates, indicating variability in productivity improvements relative to training hours. The most notable growth occurs at around 8.8k employees, where productivity peaks at 160 with intermediate training hours, suggesting potential optimal training levels for enhanced productivity. Significant turning points are observed, notably between low and moderate training hours, where productivity sees the most variation. This highlights the importance of strategic training investments tailored to employee needs to maximize productivity outcomes.
