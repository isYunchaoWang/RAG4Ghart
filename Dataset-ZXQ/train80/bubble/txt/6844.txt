The chart illustrates a varied distribution of publication counts relative to research funding, with no clear linear trend. The maximum publication count is approximately 100 and the minimum around 3. The funding range spans from $2 to $8 million. Teams with larger sizes generally associate with higher publication counts. However, there are exceptions, with both high and low publication outputs across all funding levels, indicating other influential factors. Although no clear growth trend emerges, significant variability suggests complex interactions between research funding, team size, and output productivity.
