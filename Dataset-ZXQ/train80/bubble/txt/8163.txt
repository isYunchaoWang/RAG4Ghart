The maximum sponsorship amount of around $1 billion generated a significant yet not the highest revenue of about $0.6 billion, indicating diminishing returns at higher sponsorship levels. The revenue tends to decrease with increasing sponsorship in a somewhat fluctuating manner, suggesting growth potential at lower sponsorships. Noteworthy is the highest growth near a sponsorship value close to $0.4 billion, which is a potential turning point for maximizing returns efficiently. Overall, leveraging lower sponsorships may optimize revenue with effective viewer engagement.
