The data chart illustrates a snapshot of the relationship between product price, conversion rate, and the number of sales transactions in the retail and e-commerce sector. Maximum conversion rates occur at lower price ranges, with a noticeable peak at approximately $200, where conversion is around 10%. The maximum sales transaction volume (10k) corresponds with a price at this lower range. As product prices increase, conversion rates generally decrease, with a few fluctuations observed around the $400 to $600 range. Notably, there's a sharp decline in the number of sales transactions when crossing the $800 mark, which may indicate a significant barrier affecting consumer behavior. Overall, the trend suggests a higher conversion rate for lower-priced products, with notable variance in transaction volumes across different price points.
