The analysis of the correlation between infrastructure age and reliability rate, along with average energy consumption, reveals several insights. The reliability rate generally decreases as infrastructure age increases, with the highest rate over 100% at a low age and the lowest rate at around 90% for over 20 years. The average energy consumption varies significantly, with values from 1.8k to 10k kWh/month, showing no clear correlation with reliability. The trend shows a nonlinear decrease in reliability, indicating that as infrastructure ages, its reliability tends to diminish, albeit with some fluctuations. This highlights the potential need for timely infrastructure upgrades to maintain high reliability rates.
