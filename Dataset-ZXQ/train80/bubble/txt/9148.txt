The analysis of the interaction between tourism reviews and customer satisfaction reveals a complex relationship impacted by online booking volumes. A key observation is that the highest booking volume corresponds to lower satisfaction ratings, suggesting potential areas for service improvement. Meanwhile, locations with smaller booking volumes tend to cluster around moderate to high satisfaction ratings. This trend indicates that while high volume might lead to operational challenges, balancing capacity with quality could enhance customer experiences. Identifying turning points where increased booking correlates with falling satisfaction is crucial for effective resource allocation in the tourism and hospitality sector.
