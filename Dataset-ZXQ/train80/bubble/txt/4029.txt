The analysis of the interaction between menu price and sales volume in the food and beverage industry reveals a generally stable trend. The key metrics show the maximum sales volume occurring at around 10,000 units/day with a minimum slightly above 0 units/day. The total and average sales volumes suggest a consistent level of activity across different price points. The data does not indicate a clear linear growth in relation to price changes. A significant observation is the clustering of sales volume at moderate price points with substantial restaurant locations, suggesting that market saturation¡ªrather than price alone¡ªmight impact volume. The highest growth appears around mid-range prices, where the number of locations is also significant. Overall, the industry demonstrates resilience with consistent performance across varying price and location metrics.
