The data indicates a positive correlation between training hours and productivity index, with varying numbers of employees represented by bubble sizes. The training hours range from approximately 10 to 100 hours per year, with productivity indices from about 60 to 150. The maximum productivity index is around 150 for 96 hours of training with 2.2k employees, while the minimum is around 60 for 40 hours with 426 employees.
