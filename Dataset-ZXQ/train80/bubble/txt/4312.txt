The chart illustrates the relationship between ingredient cost and profit margin in the food and beverage industry, with average customer order frequency depicted by bubble size. Key metrics indicate that profit margins range from around 0% to above 50%, and ingredient costs span from $0 to $11 per unit. The data suggests no linear correlation between ingredient cost and profit margin, as various profit margins are achieved across different cost levels. Notably, the largest customer order frequency, depicted by the largest bubble, corresponds to a mid-range profit margin and ingredient cost. Significant events include peaks where some products achieve high profit margins despite varied ingredient costs. The overall trend is non-linear with fluctuations, pointing to the complexity of factors influencing profitability beyond mere cost and frequency in the industry.
