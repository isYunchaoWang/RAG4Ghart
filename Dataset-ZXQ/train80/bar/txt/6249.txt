The data on hospital visits within a year for various towns shows considerable variation. Elmwood and Westwood are notable outliers, with Elmwood witnessing the highest number of visits at 307,204 and Westwood following closely at 465,096. In contrast, the town with the fewest visits is Mapleton, with 108,619 visits. The average number of visits across the towns is approximately 161,933. The overall trend indicates a significant fluctuation rather than a consistent increase or decrease, with major peaks in Westwood and Elmwood suggestive of unique factors driving high visitation rates in these towns. Hillcrest and Stonehill also show substantial numbers but not as pronounced as the outliers. The data highlights potential areas for resource allocation and further investigation into the factors contributing to the high number of visits in the leading towns.
