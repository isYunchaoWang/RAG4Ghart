In contrast, CoreLogic recorded the lowest revenue of 3,631 million USD. The total revenue across all companies sums up to 174,467 million USD, averaging approximately 12,462 million USD per company.

The overall trend across the companies exhibits significant variability, with no consistent upward or downward pattern, suggesting a competitive and fluctuating market.
