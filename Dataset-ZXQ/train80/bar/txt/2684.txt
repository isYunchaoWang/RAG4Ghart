The cumulative total of artworks across all cities is 11,754, providing an average of approximately 896 artworks per city. Overall, the trend in the number of artworks is neither linear nor stable, exhibiting significant peaks in Highvale and notable dips in smaller cities like Lakeview and Springfield. Significant growth is evident in Highvale, which not only has the highest total but also represents the largest increase compared to other cities.
