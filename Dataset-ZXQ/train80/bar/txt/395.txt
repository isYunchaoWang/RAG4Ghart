The analysis of crop production across different categories reveals a maximum production value of 20,000 metric tons for bananas and a minimum of 2,344 metric tons for tea. The total production for all crops is 65,326 metric tons, with an average production of 10,888 metric tons per crop. The trend indicates a gradual decline in production values from bananas to tea, with no unexpected fluctuations. The most significant decrease in production is observed between rice and barley, reflecting a strong downward gradient. Overall, the data shows a linear decrease in production volumes across the crop categories, providing clarity on the dominance of banana production over others in the given area.
