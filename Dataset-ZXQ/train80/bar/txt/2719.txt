The total number of artworks across all cities is 12240, with an average of 1020 artworks per city. Overall, the trend is not linear but rather fluctuates across the cities. Significant peaks are observed in Brookfield, Ironwood, and Elmhurst, which may indicate these cities as major art production hubs.
