Overall, the platforms exhibit a diverse range of performances, with no strictly linear trend. An apparent growth in viewership is seen, particularly from Vimeo to Weibo, with significant peaks at Bilibili and Weibo. This suggests that Weibo is a highly effective platform for video exposure, whereas Vimeo has the least reach among the platforms analyzed. A calculated average view count across all platforms indicates moderate engagement, with several platforms contributing to significant spikes in viewer interaction.
