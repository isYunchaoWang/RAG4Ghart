In 2021, the distribution of employee engagement efforts was led by Candidate Evaluation, which accounted for the largest portion at 15.64%. Ergonomics and Skill Workshops followed, contributing 13.72% and 11.21%, respectively. In contrast, categories like Job Posting and Feedback received less focus, with lower percentages of 5.12% and 6.15%. The remaining areas, such as Online Learning and Flexible Scheduling, showed a moderate distribution. This allocation indicates a strategic prioritization towards recruiting and evaluating new candidates, while continually investing in workforce skills and ergonomic support. The spread suggests a balanced approach with a heavier emphasis on candidate-related efforts.
