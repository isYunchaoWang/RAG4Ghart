The cities demonstrate a diverse range of artwork creation counts, with Quarryville leading at approximately 1700 artworks and Oakridge trailing at around 1000 artworks. The average creation count across all cities is roughly 1400. The distribution of art forms (Mural, Painting, Photography, Digital Art, Sculpture, and Textile) varies by city, but Mural and Textile are generally the more prevalent forms. The overall trend shows variation in counts between the cities rather than a uniform pattern. Significant differences in counts suggest diverse emphasis or interest levels in certain art forms in each city, but no distinct turning points or significant growth events are evident across the dataset.
