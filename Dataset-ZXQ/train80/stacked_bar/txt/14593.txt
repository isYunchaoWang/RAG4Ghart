The analysis of the monthly shipment volumes reveals that March recorded the highest total shipment at over 3000 tonnes, while April observed the lowest at just under 1000 tonnes. The trend generally shows an increasing pattern with notable peaks in March and July. The overall growth appears linear with significant fluctuations, particularly a sharp rise from December to March. A significant growth is seen from February to June, marking a key turning point with a remarkable increase in complex commodities like apparel and vehicles contributing to the growth. This pattern suggests a seasonal influence or demand spike in these months, providing opportunities for targeted supply chain enhancements.
