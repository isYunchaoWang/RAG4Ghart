The energy consumption data across different cities shows significant variation, with Dunvale reporting the highest total consumption at approximately 16,000 TWh and Yorkton the lowest at around 7,000 TWh. The overall trend does not exhibit linear growth but fluctuates significantly between cities. Notably, Elmhurst and Dunvale have markedly higher energy usage than other cities, possibly indicating a higher industrial presence or population density. Biomass and coal are consistently the most used energy types across all cities, while hydro and natural gas play a less significant role in most. The data highlights key differences in energy profiles which may reflect varying local resources or policy priorities.
