Among the four video platforms analyzed, Periscope exhibits the highest viewer engagement with a total viewership approaching 200 million views, with Education and News categories being dominant. Crunchyroll, Vimeo, and Twitter show similar, lower engagement levels, each approximately reaching 100 million views, characterized by more balanced distribution across content types. The data implies that while Periscope leads notably in viewer numbers with a significant spike, possibly due to its diverse content appeal, the other platforms maintain a stable yet less varied engagement pattern, reflecting potential opportunities for growth in content differentiation and expanded viewership.
