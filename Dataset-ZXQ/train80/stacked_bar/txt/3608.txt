The historical student enrollment statistics for the three schools from 2008 to 2020 reveal a pattern of growth, followed by a decline. The total student enrollment peaked in 2016, reaching its maximum, and was at its lowest in 2020. The most significant growth occurred from 2012 to 2016. However, after 2016, there was a notable decline in enrollment numbers. This trend suggests an initial increase in student numbers with fluctuations, peaking in 2016, followed by a downturn in subsequent years.
