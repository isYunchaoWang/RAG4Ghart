The analysis of the monthly shipment volumes for different commodities shows a notable trend from May to September. In May, the total shipment was relatively high, with significant contributions from each commodity. By August, the volume decreased, particularly in pharmaceuticals and textiles. However, September marked the highest total shipment volume, with substantial increases across all categories, especially in pharmaceuticals and textiles, indicating a significant growth phase after the dip in August. This trend suggests a pattern of initial reduction followed by a recovery in September, highlighting adaptability in shipping strategies.
