The chart illustrates tourism spending distribution across four categories: Cultural Experiences, Dining, Sightseeing, and Adventure Activities. Cultural Experiences consistently lead in expenditure, with a notable peak early in the period followed by stabilization. Dining exhibits a significant initial rise, followed by fluctuations, before aligning with the stable trend of sightseeing, which shows moderate yet steady growth. Adventure Activities maintain a consistent expenditure level overall. The initial sharp increases and subsequent stabilization suggest responsive adjustments to market trends or seasonal influences, with no marked turning points observed beyond initial spikes. Overall, spending patterns reflect initial enthusiasm followed by a balanced distribution in favor of Cultural Experiences and Dining.
