The chart presents the share of renewable energy, consisting of Biomass, Hydroelectric, and Hybrid Systems. Biomass remains relatively stable, showing slight fluctuations with no significant spikes or drops. The Hydroelectric component starts with higher variability, eventually stabilizing and maintaining a consistent share throughout. Hybrid Systems show a significant decline after an initial peak, contributing less to the overall share as the chart progresses. The overall trend reflects a consistent distribution across the categories, with no particular category dominating significantly after the initial fluctuations. The nature of the trends suggests a stabilization in the distribution of various renewable energy sources over the period.
