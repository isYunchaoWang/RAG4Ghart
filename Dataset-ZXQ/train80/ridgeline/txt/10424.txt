The chart represents the share of various renewable energy sources as a percentage. Wind energy shows a prominent peak, indicating its significant contribution. However, its value diminishes over time, suggesting a decreasing trend. Solar energy exhibits steady growth after initial fluctuations, indicating increasing adoption. Tidal, Geothermal, and Hybrid Systems show more stable and lower values, with slight variations. Biomass reveals a consistent growth after initial fluctuations, while Hydroelectric remains fairly stable. The data suggests a general shift towards solar and biomass energy sources over time, with wind energy seeing a decline post-peak. The insights highlight emerging changes in the renewable energy sector, with potential growth areas being solar and biomass.
