Peer-to-Peer Lending shows a higher peak early on, declining steadily to a near flat trend, suggesting a sharp initial growth followed by stabilization. Venture Capital displays a moderate, consistent upward curve, indicating a more stable growth pattern despite initial fluctuations. Conversely, the Stock Market exhibits a significant early trough followed by a smoother recovery, leading to a stable trend, reflecting volatility with eventual stability. Overall, each investment type demonstrates unique trends and growth characteristics, highlighting the varying risk and return profiles inherent in each method.
