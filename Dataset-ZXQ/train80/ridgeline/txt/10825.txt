The chart illustrates the share percentages of different renewable energy sources over time, displaying varied patterns of growth and fluctuation. Wind energy shows a peak in the earlier period followed by stabilization. Hydroelectric displays an initial increase with a smoother decline, while solar maintains a moderately stable distribution with minimal change. Tidal energy experiences a noticeable peak and rapid decline. Biomass remains relatively stable, showing minor fluctuations. Hybrid systems exhibit consistent growth after initial fluctuations. Overall, there is a mix of growth and stability, with significant peaks in wind and tidal energy. The general trend suggests diversification and optimization of renewable energy sources over the observed period.
