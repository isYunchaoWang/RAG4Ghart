The analysis of daily sales statistics across three product categories¡ªElectronics, Music, and Sports¡ªreveals distinct sales patterns. Electronics show a wide range of sales figures with a median sales value significantly below the upper whisker, indicating occasional high sales spikes. Music displays a narrower distribution with moderate sales volatility and a median sales value that is closer to its max potential sales compared to the other categories. The Sports category, however, displays the widest overall distribution, suggesting significant variability and the potential for both high and low daily sales. Overall, while Electronics and Sports have the potential for higher sales, the latter also shows a larger spread in sales, indicating a less stable sales pattern compared to Music.
