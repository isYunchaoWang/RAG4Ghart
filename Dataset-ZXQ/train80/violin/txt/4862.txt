The data on daily energy consumption across seven cities highlights significant variability and distinct patterns. Mapleton exhibits the highest energy consumption with a median close to 6000 MWh, while Creston has the lowest with a median under 3000 MWh. Overall, the cities with higher energy consumption (Mapleton and Pinehaven) display larger variations compared to others like Creston and Lakeview, indicating potential differences in energy needs or sources. The trend across cities does not suggest a uniform pattern, instead revealing unique profiles for each location. Notably, no significant turning points or rapid growth rates are apparent, implying that energy usage remains relatively stable for each city.
