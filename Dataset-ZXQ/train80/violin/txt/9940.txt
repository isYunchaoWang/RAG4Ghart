The analysis of daily sales statistics by product category reveals distinct differences in performance. The "Tools" category displays the highest median sales nearing 400 thousand USD, paired with a significant range indicating substantial daily fluctuations. "Music" and "Health" follow, with slightly lower median values around 250-300 thousand USD, though "Health" demonstrates the most variability. The sales distribution reflects a stable trend but with notable daily variations, particularly in "Tools." Overall, while "Tools" leads in sales potential, variability across all categories suggests opportunities for stabilization and targeted strategies to capitalize on daily peaks.
