The projected box office revenues for the movies exhibit a range with most values between $400 million and $700 million USD. "Final Reckoning" has the highest variability, indicating a wide range of revenue projections, with potential peaks above $700 million USD. "Hidden Truth" has the highest median value, suggesting strong performance expectations. The overall trend does not demonstrate significant growth across the board; rather, it appears relatively stable with each movie having its unique distribution, possibly influenced by specific factors such as franchise strength or market reception. There are no evident turning points in the data, but the variability in projections highlights differing confidence levels in expected performance.
