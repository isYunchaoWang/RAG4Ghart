In comparing fruit transportation volumes between Zephyr and Northgate, we observe distinct patterns in the data distributions. Zephyr's transportation volume ranges from approximately 20,000 to 65,000 tons, with a median around 45,000 tons. Northgate shows a slightly higher range, from roughly 25,000 to 70,000 tons, with a median near 55,000 tons. Both cities demonstrate a relatively symmetric distribution, with Zephyr showing a concentration of values below the median and Northgate having higher concentration above its median. There is no significant consistent trend of increase or decrease, but the variance indicates fluctuations in the volume transported in both cities. Northgate generally handles a higher median volume compared to Zephyr. Overall, while both cities have overlapping ranges, Northgate processes a larger volume of fruit transportation.
