Upon analyzing the virtual housing prices by property type, it is observed that each property type exhibits a distinct price distribution with variability in ranges and medians. The Urban Loft and Beach House show higher price ranges extending towards the upper end, while the Tiny House and Loft display lower median values. The data lacks a clear linear trend across property types, suggesting that prices do not consistently increase or decrease. Instead, each type appears to maintain its own price range, with notable fluctuations visible, particularly within the Beach House and Duplex categories. This indicates a diversity in valuation influenced by factors specific to each property type.
