The projected box office revenues for the movies "Last Ember," "Echoes," and "Nightfall" reveal distinct financial prospects. "Last Ember" shows the widest range of projections, reaching up to 1400 million USD, indicating the highest potential revenue, but it also has a broad uncertainty range. "Echoes" presents a more conservative and stable projection, with a lower potential high but less volatility. "Nightfall" showcases projections similar to but slightly higher than "Echoes," with a potential for moderate growth. Overall, while all movies hold significant box office potential, "Last Ember" stands out for its high revenue ceiling, albeit with greater risk.
