The boxplot of virtual housing prices across five property types¡ªCo-op, Duplex, Triplex, Urban Loft, and Townhouse¡ªreveals significant variability in prices. All categories exhibit a wide range, with pricing consistently stretching from around 400,000 USD to peak values approaching or exceeding 1,200,000 USD, particularly with noticeable outliers in all categories. The median prices appear relatively similar, but slight variations suggest a somewhat balanced distribution across property types with no clear leader. There is no overarching trending pattern, indicating stable pricing across property types. These insights suggest a competitive and varied virtual housing market without dramatic pricing shifts.
