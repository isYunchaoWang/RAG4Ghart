The data on fruit transportation across the seven cities shows variability in volume with outliers present, indicating occasional high peaks. The overall range is broad, spanning from lower volumes below 40,000 tons to peaks over 160,000 tons. Most cities, such as Yorkton and Pinehaven, exhibit higher median values, while cities like Creston and Fairmont display slightly lower medians, suggesting more consistent transportation volumes. The presence of multiple outliers across cities implies sporadic but significant surges in transportation volumes. Overall, there is no clear increasing or decreasing trend across the dataset, rather it represents stable volumes with fluctuations and occasional spikes.
