The box plot illustrates the Research and Development investment in million USD for two countries, Northgate and Pinehaven. Northgate shows a slightly higher median investment and a wider range of data, with some outliers on the lower end. Pinehaven, while having a slightly lower median, has a more constrained range with fewer outliers, except for one significant outlier on the lower side. Both countries display similar maximum values, but Northgate has a more pronounced lower quartile spread. This suggests that while both countries maintain substantial investments, the variability in investment is greater in Northgate, potentially indicating differences in investment strategies or economic conditions.
