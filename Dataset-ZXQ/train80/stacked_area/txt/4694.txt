From 1980 to 1984, the overall turnover rate among the companies depicted shows a subtle decrease. Initially reaching nearly 100% in 1980, the turnover rate observed a steady decline, reaching a slightly lower range by 1984. The trend appears to be stable with minimal fluctuations across the years, indicating no significant turning points or sharp changes. This suggests that while the turnover rate decreased slightly, the composition and distribution among the companies, such as Ironclad Industries and AstraCorp, remained largely consistent during this period without any major events or shifts in trend.
