From 1995 to 1998, the overall carbon emissions from various energy sources showed a slightly decreasing trend, despite minor fluctuations. The data reveals a modest reduction in emissions during 1996, followed by a subtle rise by 1998. The trend appears somewhat linear with a slight dip around the midpoint, indicating a small yet notable downward shift before a minor recovery towards the end of the period. The most significant change was observed between 1995 and 1996, where a reduction in emissions was most apparent. There are no major turning points, as the trend remains relatively smooth. Overall, the data indicates a brief period of improvement in emission levels, though it eventually stabilizes with a slight increase by the end of the period.
