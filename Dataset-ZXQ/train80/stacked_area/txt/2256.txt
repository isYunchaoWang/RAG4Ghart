From 1969 to 1998, the overall student-teacher ratio shows a significant upward trend, indicating continual growth over the decades. The data reveal a gradual increase initially, followed by a sharp exponential rise, particularly from the mid-1980s onwards. Meridian Academy primarily drives this growth, with the ratio expanding significantly in the latter years. Zenith Institute of Technology exhibits early growth and stabilizes by the mid-1980s. Silverhaven Polytechnic shows a steady low-level contribution throughout the period. The chart suggests major growth acceleration around the late 1980s, serving as a turning point towards a faster increase in ratios overall, highlighting potential shifts in educational structures or policies during this time.
