From 1956 to 1963, the overall trend in patient visits across the seven facilities shows a slight decline. The maximum patient visits occurred at the start of the period, while the minimum was observed towards the end. The data indicates a general reduction in visits with fluctuations throughout, rather than a linear drop. Notably, the initial years experienced more visits which then gradually decreased. The trend lacks sharp turning points or significant spikes, pointing to a steady downward trajectory with minor variations.
