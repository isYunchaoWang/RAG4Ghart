From 1959 to 1984, music festival attendance displayed a cyclical pattern with notable fluctuations. The total attendance peaked around 350,000, and troughs were nearer to 150,000. Although these numbers indicate a generally stable trend, the overall trajectory was punctuated by recurrent peaks and troughs rather than continuous growth or decline. The Azure Sky Symphony significantly contributed to these fluctuations, with periods of sharp increases followed by declines, while the Zenith Rhythm Fest and Terra Tempo Festival maintained a more stable presence. Key turning points were observed around 1965, 1973, and 1981, signifying sharp growth phases. Overall, the data reflects a vibrant festival scene characterized by dynamic attendance patterns.
