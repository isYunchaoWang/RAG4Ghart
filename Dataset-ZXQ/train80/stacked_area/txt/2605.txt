From 1975 to 1983, the overall student-teacher ratio across the four institutions displayed a steady increase with some fluctuations. The maximum ratio was around 120 in 1983, while the minimum was about 70 in 1975. The data shows a gradual growth, with a noticeable increase around the years 1981 to 1982, indicating a turning point in the trend. The growth appears linear after minor fluctuations between 1977 and 1980. The highest growth rate occurred during the early 1980s, suggesting increased student enrollment or reduced teaching staff during that period. Overall, the trend illustrates a growing demand for education relative to staffing across these institutions.
