The delivery time from 2005 to 2014 shows a slight increasing trend, characterized by steady growth across all services. The maximum delivery time occurs in the initial years, whereas the minimum is observed towards the end, indicating a gradual improvement in delivery efficiency. While express couriers and rural logistics slightly increase, same-day services and drone deliveries remain relatively stable. There are no sharp turning points, suggesting consistent service enhancement over the period. Overall, the trend reflects a positive shift towards quicker delivery solutions.
