From 1997 to 2018, employee satisfaction showed an overall declining trend after an initial period of stability and growth. The satisfaction peaked early in the 2000s and has seen a gradual decrease toward 2018. The decline suggests significant turning points, particularly post-2010, impacting all departments. The trend reflects a need for targeted interventions to address satisfaction issues, especially in the latter years.
