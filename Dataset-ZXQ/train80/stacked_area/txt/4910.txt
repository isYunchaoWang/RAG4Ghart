From 2012 to 2019, the overall absenteeism rate declined consistently. The highest rate was observed in 2012 with approximately 12%, and the lowest in 2019 with about 9%. This downward trend is linear across the period, with no significant fluctuations or turning points. The consistent reduction suggests effective measures were implemented to reduce absenteeism across all departments, including Engineering, Management, and Research & Development.
