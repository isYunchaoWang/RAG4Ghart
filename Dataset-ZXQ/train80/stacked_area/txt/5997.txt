From 1998 to 2021, construction starts exhibited noticeable fluctuations. The total number of units initiated peaked early in the observed period, demonstrating a declining trend overall with periodic surges in activity. Notably, construction starts experienced significant growth between 2009 and 2010 and again in 2014 before gradually decreasing towards the latter part of the timeline. This pattern indicates potential cyclical influences affecting the construction industry, with substantial contributions from regions like Veridian Plains and Crimson Peaks. Despite these fluctuations, the overall trend from 1998 to 2021 suggests a net decline in construction activity.
