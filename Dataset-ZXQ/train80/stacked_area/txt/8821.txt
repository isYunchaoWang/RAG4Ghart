From 1998 to 2020, the loyalty program membership has exhibited a consistent upward trend, indicating robust growth across all categories. The data begins with a lower base in 1998 and shows a steady increase through 2000-2010, followed by a more accelerated growth post-2010. By 2020, the total membership has reached its peak, more than doubling since its inception. This significant growth is reflective of increasing consumer engagement in loyalty programs, driven perhaps by enhanced value propositions and expanding market reach. The trend appears to be smooth, with no major fluctuations or downturns, indicating stable growth dynamics and possibly effective strategy execution across the different membership categories.
