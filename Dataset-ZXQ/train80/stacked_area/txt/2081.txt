From 2013 to 2023, faculty satisfaction across six institutions shows a generally stable trend with slight fluctuations. Despite some variations, the overall level of satisfaction remained relatively constant over the period. The satisfaction peaked around 2018 and saw some decline afterwards, particularly notable between 2020 and 2022. Significant growth was observed between 2014 and 2018, with a slight downturn following. The chart indicates a return towards previous levels as of 2023, suggesting some recovery in satisfaction. Overall, the pattern represents a non-linear trajectory with both periods of growth and decline, reflecting potential external or internal influences impacting faculty satisfaction at these institutions.
