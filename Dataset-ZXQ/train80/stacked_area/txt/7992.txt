The overall average daily active users are consistent, around 4 billion. Notably, Luminara shows significant variability, with a peak around 2021 followed by a decline towards 2024, marking a key turning point in user activity. The trend shape suggests growth after fluctuations, primarily driven by Luminara's changes. Other platforms, such as CrimsonLink and EchoWave, remain relatively stable, contributing to the overall consistent user base.
