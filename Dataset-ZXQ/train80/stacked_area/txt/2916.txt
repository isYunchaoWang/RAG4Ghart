The analysis of natural gas prices from 1978 to 1994 reveals a clear decreasing trend over the years. Initially starting above $10 per cubic meter, there is a steady decline throughout the period, eventually reaching below $5 by 1994. This trend appears relatively linear, with consistent annual decreases without significant fluctuations. The GeoHeat Commodity appears to be the most volatile component, contributing to minor variations, but overall, the trajectory remains downward. No significant turning points or rapid growth periods are observed; instead, the decline is gradual and consistent, reflecting broader market dynamics during this timeframe.
