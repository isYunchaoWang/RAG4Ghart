From 1995 to 2012, in-store foot traffic has generally shown a decreasing trend, characterized by an overall decline with some fluctuations. The maximum daily visitors were at the start of the period, while the minimum occurred towards the end. The total visitor count decreased, averaging significantly lower in the later years. Notably, there was a spike in foot traffic around 2006, after which the decline continued sharply. This suggests a transition in consumer behavior, possibly driven by the rise of online shopping options affecting traditional in-store experiences.
