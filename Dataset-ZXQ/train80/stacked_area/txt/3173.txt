Between 1981 and 2000, the electricity demand, measured in MWh, showed a general upward trend, marked by seasonal fluctuations. The total demand increased steadily over time, with periodic spikes indicating higher consumption at intervals. The maximum demand occurred towards the late 1990s, while the minimum occurred at the beginning of the timeline. Overall, the demand trajectory can be characterized as growth after fluctuations, with significant increases especially in the latter years, suggesting robust energy consumption patterns and possibly corresponding economic activities.
