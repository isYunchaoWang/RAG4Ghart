From 1972 to 1985, the daily active user base for both Luminara and CrimsonLink demonstrated a declining trend. Initially, the combined user count was around 1.75 billion, with the maximum value observed at the start of the period. This gradually decreased to reach its minimum near the end, fluctuating slightly in certain years. While there were some temporary rises, notably around 1980 and 1983, these did not sustain, indicating a primarily decreasing pattern with slight periodic recoveries. No drastic turning point reversed the overall downward trajectory, suggesting the need for strategic intervention to attract and retain users.
