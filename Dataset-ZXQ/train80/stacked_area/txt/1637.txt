From 1969 to 1983, the total number of art gallery visitors demonstrated a generally stable trend with slight fluctuations. The maximum number of visitors was observed around 1974, while the minimum appeared closer to 1969. The data reflects a consistent average over the years, without any significant peaks or valleys to indicate drastic changes. A noticeable growth occurred in the mid-1970s, but this was not sustained, and attendance levels subsequently stabilized. Overall, the period shows a balanced visitor turnout across the different galleries, with no significant turning points suggesting a major shift in visitor patterns.
