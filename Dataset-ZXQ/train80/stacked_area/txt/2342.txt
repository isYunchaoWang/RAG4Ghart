From 1997 to 2008, research funding across the institutions exhibited a generally increasing trend, characterized by a pattern of growth following initial fluctuations. Initially, there were noticeable ups and downs, particularly around the early 2000s. However, post-2003, the trend stabilized and showed consistent growth, peaking in 2008. The overall shape of the growth trend can be described as non-linear, with significant yet uneven increases, particularly highlighted in the latter half of the period. The highest growth occurred between 2007 and 2008, marking a notable turning point and demonstrating a robust investment in research funding nearing the end of the period.
