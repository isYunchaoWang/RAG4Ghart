From 1979 to 1990, the student enrollment across the seven institutions depicted in the chart showed a broadly increasing trend. Enrollment numbers started at approximately 60,000 in 1979 and steadily grew to surpass 100,000 by 1990, reflecting a significant growth rate over the period. The trend was largely linear, though there were minor fluctuations, particularly in the early to mid-1980s, which did not detract from the overall upward trajectory. Notably, the most substantial growth occurred in the latter part of the period, particularly from 1987 onward, indicating a strong rise in enrollment numbers. The consistent upward trend suggests heightened interest and capacity in higher education during these years.
