From 1997 to 2021, research grants awarded demonstrated a consistent upward trend across all institutions, with no significant declines or fluctuations. The total funding showed steady growth, transitioning into a more accelerated increase post-2015. This suggests a linear growth trend initially, evolving into exponential growth in recent years. Aether University, Echo Research, and Starburst College all contributed to this upward movement, with notable increases particularly evident in the last decade, indicating an expanding research investment landscape.
