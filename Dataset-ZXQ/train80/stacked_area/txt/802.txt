From 1964 to 1972, the interest rates for both Silverhaven Reserve Bank and Borealis Investment Council experienced a gradual decline. The rates started relatively high, reaching their peak in the initial years, with a gradual downward trend over the period. No significant turning points or sharp increases were observed, indicating a stable yet slowly decreasing trend. The shape of the trend suggests a steady decline, rather than abrupt fluctuations, reflecting a consistent policy approach by both institutions.
