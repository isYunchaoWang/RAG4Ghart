Aether Corp maintained a consistently dominant presence, especially in the later years, peaking around 2018. Luminara Solutions and Oracle Systems experienced significant fluctuations but maintained their positions throughout the period. Echo Dynamics and Crimson Group had minimal changes with slight growth observed around the middle years. The most notable growth was in the applications for Aether Corp, which showed significant increases from 2016 onward, indicating a strategic focus on innovation. There were no drastic turning points, but a steady increase in applications from certain companies suggests ongoing industry competitiveness and emphasis on patenting innovative technologies.
