From 1965 to 1977, the overall productivity rate, encompassing the Engineering Department, Research & Development, Operations Staff, and Management Team, exhibits a fluctuating yet generally stable trend. The graph indicates cycles of increases and decreases across the years rather than a linear progression. Significant growth is observed between 1976 and 1977, suggesting a notable improvement in productivity by the end of the period. The Management Team shows the highest variance, indicating potential turning points and the most dynamic contribution to productivity rates.
