From 1972 to 2001, the overall food cost percentages for the establishments depicted show a general upward trend, signifying increased food costs over time. Initially, from 1972 to the mid-1980s, there are modest fluctuations with an overall downward trend in costs. Post-1985, the trend shifts to a steady increase, particularly evident in the largest section representing Crimson Plate, which shows significant growth, indicating the largest share in food cost percentages by 2001. The data reveals a stabilization period around the mid-1990s before resuming its upward trajectory. This suggests a possible industry-wide adjustment or external factor influencing food costs before rising again into the late 1990s and early 2000s.
