From 1968 to 1996, the overall number of visitors to the art galleries showed a stable to slightly increasing trend, with fluctuations observed throughout the period. The visitor count for each gallery tended to rise over time, particularly notable in the Ironwood Gallery and The Gilded Frame. The data displayed some oscillations, but the general shape of the trend was an upward growth with periods of stabilization. The most significant growth appeared in the mid-1980s, which marks a turning point where a consistent increase in visitors became evident. Despite fluctuations, the visitor numbers across the galleries progressively trended upward, indicating a gradual rise in overall interest in the art galleries during these years.
