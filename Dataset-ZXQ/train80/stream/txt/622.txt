From 1965 to 1994, the organic farming area across Ironwood Ranch, Golden Harvest Cooperative, Misty Meadow Acres, and Whispering Willows Estate experienced modest growth. The overall trend indicates a gradual increase in organic farmland, with fluctuations yet showing a net upward trajectory. The expansion was consistent with some peaks, particularly noticeable at periods around the mid-1980s and early 1990s. No drastic turning points were observed, with growth appearing relatively steady across all estates.
