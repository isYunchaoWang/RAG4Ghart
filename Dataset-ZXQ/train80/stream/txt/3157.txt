From 1982 to 1999, the carbon emissions from Borealis Renewables and Stellar Grid Solutions exhibited an overall increasing trend. Although there were some fluctuations, the trend demonstrated steady growth, particularly towards the latter part of the period. Borealis Renewables consistently contributed more to the overall emissions compared to Stellar Grid Solutions. The most significant growth in emissions occurred in the late 1990s, indicating a notable rise in emission levels towards the end of the observed timeframe. No sharp turning points were detected, suggesting a gradual escalation consistent with linear or slightly accelerated growth.
