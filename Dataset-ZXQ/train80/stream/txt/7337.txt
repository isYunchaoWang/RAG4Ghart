From 1960 to 1982, the technology adoption rate displays an overall increasing trend among the three groups: rural communities, the elderly population, and students. This growth is characterized by a steady rise over the period, with minor fluctuations observed particularly around the mid-1970s and early 1980s. The most significant growth is recorded toward the latter years, indicating a faster rate of adoption. No major turning points are evident; rather, the adoption continues to climb steadily, suggesting a positive reception and integration of technology in these demographics.
