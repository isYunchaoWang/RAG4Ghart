From 1951 to 1968, the overall delivery time has shown a decreasing trend. Initial years experienced some fluctuations, but from around 1955 onwards, there is a noticeable linear decline in delivery time. This trend is largely driven by the significant increase in the efficiency of drone delivery, which has gradually become the dominant mode of reducing delivery duration compared to other methods. While other modes like Rural Logistics, Autonomous Vehicles, and International Freight contribute variously, drone technology stands out as the pivotal factor for the observed improvement in delivery times across these years.
