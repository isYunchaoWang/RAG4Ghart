From 1959 to 1978, cross-border delays generally exhibited an upward trend, with fluctuations throughout the period. The primary contributors to delays were sanitary inspections and security checks, both showing a gradual increase. There's noticeable variability across the years, indicating potential interruptions or changes in operational processes. A significant increase in delays is apparent around the early 1970s, hinting at influential external factors. Although there are periodic downturns, the overall progression suggests a steady increase in cumulative delay hours. This analysis highlights the growing complexity and impact of various logistical and regulatory factors on border operations over these two decades.
