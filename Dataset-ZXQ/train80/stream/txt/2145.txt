From 1988 to 1997, overall library visits demonstrated a stable yet slightly increasing trend, with fluctuations throughout the years. The total visits show a consistent presence from all libraries, with no dramatic increases or decreases, indicating a steady interest in library resources. Notably, there are no sharp turning points, suggesting a gradual adaptation rather than sudden changes in visitation patterns. The most significant growth occurred between 1995 and 1997, particularly in the Borealis Research Hub and Celestial College Archives, contributing to the upward trend in this period. Overall, libraries maintained a robust presence in the community across the decade.
