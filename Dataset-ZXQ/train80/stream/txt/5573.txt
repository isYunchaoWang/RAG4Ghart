The construction starts from 1971 to 1996 reveal a general upward trend with fluctuations across the four regions: Azure Coast, Sunstone Desert, Veridian Plains, and Golden Delta. Initially, the values are relatively stable with minor ups and downs, but from the mid-1980s onward, there is a noticeable increase culminating in a peak around 1996. The growth is not linear; it occurs more significantly after 1990, indicating a period of rapid expansion, especially in Azure Coast and Veridian Plains. The most significant growth appears in the Azure Coast region, contributing prominently to the overall increase. The trend suggests positive momentum in construction starts, particularly in the latter years leading to 1996.
