The analysis of the food cost percentages from 1981 to 1996 reveals a generally increasing trend overall. Notably, there is no single, consistent linear growth pattern; instead, there are fluctuations with periods of growth followed by slight declines and stabilizations. The maximum value of food cost percentage occurs towards the end of the timeframe, indicating a growth across most categories. The minimum values appear earlier in the timeframe. The average value appears to have grown over the period, suggesting that on average, food costs as a percentage have increased. Significant growth is particularly evident in the years towards the later part of the timeline, particularly around 1994 to 1996, indicating a period of higher growth rates. There are notable fluctuations and turning points, especially around the mid-1980s and early 1990s, where there were visible dips and increases in percentage. Overall, this suggests an upward trend in food costs as a percentage, with occasional fluctuations that may be due to external economic factors or internal business strategies.
