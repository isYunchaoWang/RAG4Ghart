The electricity demand from 2000 to 2021 shows a fluctuating yet overall stable trend. Initially, the combined demand experienced some fluctuations, with notable peaks around 2010. After that period, the demand stabilized and remained relatively consistent through 2021. The Aethelgard Power Grid experienced a significant spike around 2010, contributing to the overall increase during that time. Despite these fluctuations, no major turning points or sustained growth trends are evident in the later years. The data suggests a balance in electricity demand between the Aethelgard Power Grid and the Meridian Energy Network over this time frame.
