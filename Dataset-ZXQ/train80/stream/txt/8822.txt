The luggage loss rate from 1959 to 1987 shows a fluctuating pattern across different modes of transportation, with no clear linear trend. There is notable variability, particularly in Ferry Services and International Terminals. The overall luggage loss rate doesn't show a consistent increase or decrease; rather, it varies with periods of growth and decline. Significant fluctuations occurred around 1973 and 1985, indicating potential turning points in luggage safety improvements. Despite these changes, the rates for Shared Ride and High-Speed Trains remain relatively steady, contributing to a more stable overall luggage loss rate trend.
