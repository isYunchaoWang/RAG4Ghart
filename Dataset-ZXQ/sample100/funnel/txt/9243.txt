The e-commerce user purchase funnel demonstrates a sequential decrease in user engagement at each stage, starting from 13,590 users visiting the product page to just 3,160 leaving a product review. The maximum engagement is at the product page visit, while the minimum is in leaving reviews. Overall, this trend shows a consistent and expected decline, indicating a typical funnel shape with no unexpected drops or spikes, reflecting predictable user behavior in e-commerce. Improvements could focus on reducing drop-offs at key stages such as checkout and payment to enhance conversion rates.
