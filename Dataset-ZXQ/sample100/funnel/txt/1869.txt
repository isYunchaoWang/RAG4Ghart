The client acquisition process shows a clear decreasing trend from the initial stage of lead capture (806 clients) to the final negotiation stage (190 clients). The maximum value is 806, while the minimum is 190. The total number of clients decreases steadily through each stage, with significant drop-offs observed particularly from "Initial Contact" to "Needs Analysis" and from "Needs Analysis" to "Proposal Sent." Overall, the chart illustrates a funnel-shaped process, typical of client acquisition, where a large number of initial leads gradually reduces to a smaller pool of potential clients ready for negotiation. The process appears efficient in filtering, with a visible narrowing as the stages progress.
