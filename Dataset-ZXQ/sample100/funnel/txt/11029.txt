The data reveals a decreasing trend in social media engagement across six user activities, from viewing content to content creation. The maximum engagement is observed with content viewing at 300 million users, while the minimum is in content creation or upload with 52 million users. The total user engagement across all activities sums to 780 million, with an average of 130 million users per activity. This funnel-shaped trend indicates a diminishing level of active engagement, likely due to the increasing effort required as users progress from passive to active participation. The most significant drop is between content viewing and liking/commenting, highlighting a turning point where engagement substantially decreases. Overall, the analysis underscores the challenge of converting passive viewers into active contributors in the social media landscape.
