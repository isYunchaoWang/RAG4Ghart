The data on energy generation and distribution highlights a consistent decrease at each stage of the process from the initial generation of 79,638 megawatt hours down to a paid consumption of 14,116 megawatt hours. This trend illustrates a linear decrease with no significant fluctuations or turning points. The most substantial drop occurs between the stages of being delivered to end users and billed consumption, indicating a major loss or discrepancy in unbilled energy. Overall, energy experiences a loss of efficiency at each level, which could be a focus for improving the system's effectiveness and revenue collection.
