The real estate sales process funnel shows a clear step-by-step attrition from the initial stage to the final stage. Starting with 434 properties listed, each subsequent phase sees a reduction in numbers, culminating in 65 post-sale surveys. The process reflects a stable, funnel-shaped decline in engagement, typical of conversion processes in sales. The most significant drop occurs between the negotiation and contract signing stages, with a reduction from 187 to 141 properties. This indicates a critical point in the sales process that may benefit from focused attention to improve conversion rates. The overall trend aligns with standard sales funnel behavior, where a gradual decrease through stages is expected.
