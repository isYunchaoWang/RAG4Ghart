The data from the e-commerce user purchase funnel indicates a consistent decrease in user engagement as they move down the funnel stages. Initially, 14,429 users visit the product page, with this number progressively declining through each subsequent stage, culminating in 2,084 users completing a purchase. The most significant drop occurs from "Visit Product Page" to "Add to Wishlist," highlighting a potential area for optimization. The trend is a typical funnel shape, illustrating a sequential process with decreasing user numbers at each stage. Overall, the completion rate from page visits to purchases suggests areas for targeted interventions to improve conversion rates at each stage of the funnel.
