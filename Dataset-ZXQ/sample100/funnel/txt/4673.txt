The energy generation and distribution funnel demonstrates a significant drop from post-generation, starting at 97,592 megawatt hours, to the eventual paid consumption at 8,944 megawatt hours. The most prominent reductions occur from post-generation to post-transmission and then to post-distribution, indicating substantial energy loss predominantly through these stages. The trend reflects a consistent decrease in available energy at each stage of the process, from generation through to consumption, with the smallest losses at the billing and paid consumption stages. This analysis highlights inefficiencies in the transmission and distribution phases, which could benefit from focused improvements to reduce energy loss.
