The chart representing energy generation and distribution reveals a sequential decline across key stages, starting with 95,067 MWh post-transmission and progressively decreasing to 19,541 MWh for paid consumption. Notably, the largest reduction occurs between post-distribution and the delivered stage, indicating significant losses. The overall trend is steadily downward, characteristic of a funnel shape with no apparent fluctuations or growth phases. This highlights potential inefficiencies at various stages of distribution and billing that may be targeted for optimization to improve energy retention down the line.
