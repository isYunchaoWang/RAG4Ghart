The data illustrates a declining funnel trend in the patient referral process, beginning with 1,325 initial consultations and culminating in 199 completed treatments. The highest attrition occurs between the stages of Diagnostic Testing and Diagnosis Confirmed. The overall trend is a steady decrease in numbers at each stage, reflecting typical attrition in a medical process funnel. No significant growth points or turning points are present, indicating a consistent yet expected drop-off through the treatment process. The data underscores the natural winnowing of patient numbers from consultation to completion.
