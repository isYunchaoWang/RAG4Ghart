The data illustrates the conversion funnel in a real estate sales process, showing a sequential decline from properties viewed (758) to post-sale survey completions (90). Each stage naturally experiences a decrease, with the most significant drop occurring from negotiation (431) to contract signed (240), indicating a critical transition point in the process. The overall trend is a clear and expected narrowing from initial interest to final post-sale activities, signaling the typical attrition in a sales process. This funnel shape suggests potential areas for improvement, particularly in converting negotiations into contract signings more effectively.
