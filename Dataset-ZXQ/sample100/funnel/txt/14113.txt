The data from the Freight Logistics Order Processing funnel shows a decreasing trend across stages. The highest value occurs at the initial stage of selecting a carrier or service (2,651 thousand shipments), and the lowest value is at the final stage of providing feedback or rating (494 thousand shipments). The total number of shipments across all stages is 7,985 thousand, with an average of 1,331 thousand per stage. A significant drop-off is noted between selecting a carrier and booking transport, indicating a potential area for process improvement. The overall trend illustrates a linear decrease, with the most considerable reduction (1,026 thousand shipments) between the first and second stages, suggesting this as a focal point for optimizing the logistics process.
