The Freight Logistics Order Processing funnel depicts a clear decreasing trend in the number of shipments as they progress through each stage. Starting with 4,218 shipments in the "Search Transport Options" phase, there is a significant drop to 2,109 in the "Select Carrier or Service" phase. Subsequent stages show further declines, with 875 shipments reaching the "Book Transport Service" stage and the smallest number, 756 shipments, reaching the "Prepare for Pickup" stage. The largest decrease occurs initially, from searching to selecting, indicating a high dropout rate early in the process. This suggests a potential area of improvement for retaining more shipments as they move through each processing stage.
