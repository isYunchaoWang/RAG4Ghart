The employee recruitment funnel demonstrates a clear decreasing trend as candidates progress through each stage, from 100% at the application submission phase down to 22% at the offer acceptance stage. The maximum value of 100% is observed at the start, reflecting all submitted applications, while the minimum of 22% is seen at the final stage where offers are accepted. The stages show a consistent reduction, characterized largely by an exponential decline rather than a linear drop. Particularly significant is the stage between the HR interview and the technical interview, where the acceptance rate drops from 68% to 51%, indicating a critical point where a substantial number of candidates are filtered out. This reduction continues to amplify towards the end with only 36% of the initial applicants receiving an offer, and ultimately just 22% accepting it. This analysis highlights critical areas for potential improvement in the recruitment process, specifically by capturing the reasons behind the attrition at these key stages.
