The data illustrates a typical e-commerce funnel starting with 7,138 users visiting the product page and gradually decreasing through each subsequent step to 1,627 users completing the purchase. The maximum value is at the top of the funnel (visits), and the minimum is at the bottom (completed purchases). This represents a common decreasing trend in user activity through the purchase process, characterized by a linear decline. The most significant drop occurs between 'Add to Wishlist' and 'Add to Cart,' indicating a potential area for process improvement. The gradual decrease continues with lower but significant drop-offs at each step, suggesting critical stages where user engagement could be enhanced to increase conversions.
