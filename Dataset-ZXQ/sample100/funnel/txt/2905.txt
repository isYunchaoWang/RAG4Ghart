The data from the chart shows a clear stepwise reduction in percentages at each stage of the cultural artwork exhibition process, beginning with 100% of artworks created and ending with 24% acquired by institutions. The most significant drop occurs between the "Shortlisted for Acquisition" and "Eligible for Acquisition" stages, indicating a potential bottleneck in advancing artworks for institutional interest. Overall, the trend indicates a diminishing nature as artworks progress through the stages, suggesting that while many artworks are created and submitted, only a select few reach the final stage of institutional acquisition.
