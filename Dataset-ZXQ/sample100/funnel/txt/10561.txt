The Engineering Project Lifecycle chart outlines a decreasing trend across different phases. Starting at the Design Phase with a complete 100%, it drops significantly through subsequent stages¡ªPrototype Development at 65%, Testing and Validation at 38%, and finally, Final Design Approval at 30%. This indicates a notable reduction in percentages as the project progresses. The most significant reduction, a decrease of 35 percentage points, occurs between the Design Phase and Prototype Development. Overall, the lifecycle highlights a linear decrease, suggesting potential challenges or resource drop-offs at each phase transition.
