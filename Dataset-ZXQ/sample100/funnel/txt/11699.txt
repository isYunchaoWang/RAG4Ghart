The social media engagement data reveals a funnel-shaped trend, starting from high engagement in activities like liking or commenting (473 million users) and narrowing down to joining groups or communities (124 million users). The maximum engagement is with likes or comments, while the minimum is evident in group or community joining. The total user interactions across these categories sum to 1,019 million, with an average of approximately 255 million users per activity. This indicates a decreasing trend in engagement intensity from passive to more active social media participation, with the most significant drop occurring between sharing content and following accounts. The data suggests that while users readily engage with lighter interactions, more committed actions attract fewer participants.
