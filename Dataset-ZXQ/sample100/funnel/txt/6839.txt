The patient referral flow reveals a declining trend from the initial consultation phase to the post-treatment assessment phase. Starting at 2,059 initial consultations, there is a consistent decrease at each stage, concluding with 523 patients reaching post-treatment assessment. The most significant drop occurs between the initial consultation and diagnostic testing, with a 383-patient decrease. The overall trend exhibits a linear and steady decline without significant fluctuations. This suggests potential drop-off points at each stage that could be investigated to improve patient retention and transition through the referral process.
