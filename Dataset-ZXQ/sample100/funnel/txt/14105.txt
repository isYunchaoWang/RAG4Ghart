The freight logistics order processing funnel highlights a significant drop-off from the initial search phase, which records 3166 thousand shipments, to the final feedback stage, which sees 693 thousand shipments. The maximum value occurs at the search phase, while the feedback stage marks the minimum. The total number of shipments processed through all stages amounts to 9941 thousand, with an average of approximately 1420 thousand per stage. The overall trend shows a consistent decrease as the process progresses, typical of a funnel model. The most substantial decrease occurs between selecting a carrier (2038 thousand) and booking the service (1378 thousand). There are no significant turning points, indicating a steady attrition through the stages. This analysis suggests opportunities for improvement in customer retention at decisive steps like service booking and preparation for pickup.
