The patient referral flow data indicates a decreasing trend through the stages, starting from 4,694 initial consultations and narrowing down to 1,276 treatment initiations. The maximum value is noted at the initial consultation stage, while the minimum is at the treatment initiation stage. The total across all stages is 12,944, yielding an average of approximately 2,589 per stage. The decline from initial consultation to treatment initiation suggests a significant attrition with the most substantial drop-off occurring between initial consultations and diagnostic testing. While each subsequent stage shows a consistent decrease, no sharp fluctuations or turning points are evident, implying a linear decrease through the patient referral process. This indicates potential areas for optimization in bridging the gaps between initial consultations and subsequent stages of the patient treatment process.
