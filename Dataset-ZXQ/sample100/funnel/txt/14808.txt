The freight logistics order processing funnel demonstrates a gradual decline in shipment numbers at each stage, from 3,654 thousand during preparation for pickup to 772 thousand for feedback or ratings. The data reveals a significant drop after preparation, with shipments beginning transportation at 2,076 thousand, completing delivery at 956 thousand, and finally receiving feedback. The most considerable decline occurs between the preparation and transportation phases, indicating potential inefficiencies. The overall trajectory suggests a steady decrease in numbers, with each stage losing more than the previous, but no significant turning points are observed. This pattern highlights the areas for improvement in transportation execution and delivery completion phases to retain more shipments through the entire process.
