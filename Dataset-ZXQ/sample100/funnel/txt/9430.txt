The e-commerce user purchase chart depicts a funnel where the initial interest with 7907 users visiting the product page narrows down significantly to 1287 users leaving product reviews. The maximum engagement is at the visit product page stage, and the minimum is observed in leaving product reviews. The total number of participations across stages is 24,897, with an average of 4,149 users per stage. The trend displays a typical funnel shape with a consistent decrease at each stage, indicating a linear drop-off as users progress. The most significant reduction occurs from visiting product pages to adding to the wishlist, with a drop of 2817 users, while the steepest percentage decline is observed from entering payment information to completing the purchase. No turning points are apparent, suggesting a steady refinement of potential customers at each conversion step. The analysis indicates a need for targeted strategies to retain user engagement through the funnel, particularly at critical drop-off points.
