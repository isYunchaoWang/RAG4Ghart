The Engineering Project Lifecycle chart reflects a clear, linear progression through various stages, culminating in the Testing and Validation phase at 100%. The key metrics identify Market Release as the minimum stage at 20% and Testing and Validation as the maximum at 100%, with the stages showing a gradual increase. The average completion across stages is 58.75%. Notably, there is a consistent upward trend through each phase, from Market Release to Testing and Validation, illustrating a linear growth without significant fluctuations or turning points. The project advances steadily through each stage, indicating a systematic approach to lifecycle management.
