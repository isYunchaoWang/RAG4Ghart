The energy generation and distribution process undergoes a significant decline in throughput as energy moves through each stage from generation to consumption. Starting with a total generation of 66,189 MWh, the amount reduces to 40,583 MWh post-generation, eventually reaching a final billed consumption of 12,748 MWh. The most substantial decreases occur from the post-generation to the post-transmission stage and again from post-transmission to post-distribution. These declines reflect potential inefficiencies or losses occurring at these stages, suggesting a need for improved processes or technologies to enhance efficiency and minimize wastage for better energy management.
