The Engineering Project Lifecycle chart illustrates a clear declining trend through its stages, starting with Project Initiation at 100% and dropping incrementally down to Final Design Approval at 15%. The most significant decrease occurs between the Project Initiation and Design Phase stages. There is a consistent reduction across each phase, without any fluctuations or reversals, indicating a linear decline. This pattern highlights the attrition typical in project lifecycles, where each stage undergoes natural filtering and refinement, resulting in fewer projects reaching final approval.
