The funnel chart for e-commerce user purchases highlights a gradual decrease in user engagement at each subsequent step in the purchasing process. Initially, 18,490 users add items to their wishlist, but only 11,304 proceed to add these items to their cart. This decline becomes more pronounced with 6,703 users initiating checkout, 5,113 entering payment information, and finally, just 4,565 completing the purchase. The data reveals a consistent drop-off at each stage, with the most significant reductions after adding to the wishlist and from initiating checkout to entering payment information. These findings suggest potential areas for improvement in cart conversion and checkout processes to reduce user drop-off and enhance overall sales.
