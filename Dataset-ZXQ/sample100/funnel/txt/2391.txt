The funnel chart represents the stages in the cultural artwork exhibition process, starting with 100% of submissions. The approval percentage decreases at each subsequent stage, with the highest rate of decline occurring between "Eligible for Acquisition" (23%) and "Institutionally Acquired" (20%). The chart shows a notable drop from "Submitted for Review" to "Approved for Exhibition" and smaller incremental declines through to the final acquisition stage. The overall trend reveals a consistently decreasing pattern, indicative of a selective process with significant attrition at each stage.
