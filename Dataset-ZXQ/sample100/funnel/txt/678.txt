The analysis of the agricultural supply chain reveals a clear decreasing trend as products move through the stages, starting with a post-harvest quantity of 17,477 tons and ending with 5,788 tons delivered to retail. This trend reflects the expected attrition as the products undergo processing, quality inspection, and packaging. The largest reduction occurs between the post-processing and filtered by quality inspection stages, indicating significant filtering during quality checks. Overall, the supply chain displays a consistent and predictable pattern of reduction through each stage without any abrupt fluctuations.
