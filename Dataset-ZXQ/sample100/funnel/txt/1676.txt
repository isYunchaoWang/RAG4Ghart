The client acquisition funnel shows a clear narrowing from lead capture to proposal sent. Starting with 1,005 leads, only 229 progress to the proposal stage. The trend indicates a decreasing conversion rate through each funnel stage, suggesting potential areas for improvement in converting initial contacts to proposals. Enhancing the transition between initial contact and needs analysis, where there is a notable drop, could notably improve overall efficiency and effectiveness in client acquisition.
