The employee recruitment process depicted in the funnel chart shows a consistent decrease at each stage. Starting from a 100% view rate for job postings, there is a gradual reduction through each recruitment step: 84% of candidates submit applications, 69% progress to the phone screen, 54% reach the HR interview, 37% advance to the technical interview, and ultimately, 24% receive an offer. The trend reflects a linear decline through the recruitment stages, with the most significant percentage drop occurring between the HR interview and technical interview stages (a 17% decrease). There are no unexpected turning points, indicating a steady filtering process inherent to recruitment pipelines. The data suggests strategic areas for potential improvement, particularly within the more significant drop-off stages, to enhance the efficiency of talent acquisition.
