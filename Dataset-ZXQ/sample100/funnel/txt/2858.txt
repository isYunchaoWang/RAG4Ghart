The funnel chart illustrates the sequential filtering of cultural artwork through various stages from submission to institutional acquisition. The process starts with 100% submission for review and narrows to 13% institutional acquisition. Each stage represents a decrease in percentage, indicating a consistent and significant reduction at each step. The largest drop occurs between "Eligible for Acquisition" (27%) and "Institutionally Acquired" (13%), highlighting a crucial bottleneck in acquisition. Overall, the trend demonstrates a systematic narrowing of selection, typical of a funnel process, with a steady decline rather than fluctuating transitions.
