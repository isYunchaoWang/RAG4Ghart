The analysis of tourist booking and travel data reveals a clear diminishing trend as tourists move from viewing destination information to checking in at hotels. Initially, 2610 thousand tourists view destination information. This number decreases steadily through each subsequent stage, with a notable drop when moving to flight booking (968 thousand) and further to making reservations (967 thousand). The final check-in figure is 480 thousand tourists. The overall pattern is a consistent linear decline, highlighting potential drop-off points, particularly in flight booking and reservations, that may need attention to improve conversion rates through the funnel stages.
