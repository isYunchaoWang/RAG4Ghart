The data analysis reveals that the activities related to science and engineering are distributed across various fields with varying levels of intensity. The maximum value observed is 0.95, indicating the highest engagement in certain areas like "Patents" and "Maintenance" during the Aerospace phase. The minimum value is 0.07, which corresponds to the "Testing" phase in Software. The overall trend shows a decreasing pattern across categories as the fields transition from Aerospace to Software. Although the decrease seems mostly linear, certain areas experience significant drops, particularly in Implementation and Patents. High initial values in Maintenance and Patents demonstrate strong early engagement, but the substantial decrease towards Software suggests areas for potential growth and focus. The distribution indicates the need for strategic approaches to balance and enhance activity levels across all engineering sectors.
