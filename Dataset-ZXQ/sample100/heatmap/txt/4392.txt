The engagement levels across the healthcare sectors reveal notable variations, with Technology Adoption and Access displaying the highest levels of engagement. The maximum value observed is 0.93, occurring in both Technology Adoption with Telemedicine and Prevention with Pharmaceuticals, indicating strong engagement in these areas. In contrast, the minimum value is 0.21 for Patient Satisfaction with Clinics and Telemedicine, suggesting these areas may require attention. The overall trend shows a mix of high engagements in specific areas, particularly where technology and prevention intersect, alongside areas that have lower interactions. There is no singular upward or downward trend; rather, there are fluctuations depending on the specific healthcare dimension and context. Key turning points include the pronounced engagement in preventive measures and their integration with pharmaceuticals, suggesting a focused improvement in these practices. To enhance healthcare engagement, leveraging technology effectively while addressing lower satisfaction areas could provide comprehensive benefits.
