The data analysis of transportation and logistics reveals several insights. The maximum value of 0.94 occurs multiple times across different categories, while the minimum value of 0.19 is observed in the sustainability dimension during Maritime and Planning phases. The overall total and average values indicate a moderate level of performance across categories. The trend analysis reflects a generally stable pattern with mild fluctuations, indicating neither a significant increase nor decrease in metrics. The most significant growth is noted in efficiency and labor within the Maritime sector, both peaking at 0.94. No dramatic turning points are identified, suggesting steady progress without major disruptions. Overall, the results suggest a balanced trajectory with room for targeted improvements in lower-performing sectors like sustainability.
