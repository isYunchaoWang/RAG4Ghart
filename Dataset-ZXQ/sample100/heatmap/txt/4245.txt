The performance heatmap of the healthcare sector illustrates a general decline in key metrics from Clinics to Telemedicine. The maximum performance value recorded is 0.92, observed in both "Outcomes" at Clinics and "Patient Satisfaction" at Hospitals, while the minimum value is 0.23, seen in "Outcomes" at Telemedicine. The average performance across all categories is approximately 0.57. Throughout the data, there is a noticeable decreasing trend that appears relatively linear with no significant fluctuations. The most substantial growth occurs in the initial segments, specifically from Medical Devices to Pharmaceutics, though this growth is limited and quickly turns into a decline. These insights suggest that while initial sectors maintain high performance levels, there¡¯s a substantial drop in efficiency as the focus shifts towards emerging areas like Public Health and Telemedicine.
