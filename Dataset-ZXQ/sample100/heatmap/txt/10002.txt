The matrix exhibits varying levels of correlation between different transportation and logistics factors. Efficiency has strong correlations across the board, particularly with Air (0.93) and Road (0.82), while other factors like Safety and Labor also display significant peaks in specific transportation modes such as Maritime and Rail, respectively. Overall, the highest correlation value is seen in Labor with Planning at 1.00, indicating a perfect match. Conversely, the lowest correlations are noted in areas such as Labor and Intermodal (0.01), highlighting areas of potential inefficiency or lack of synergy. The matrix indicates diverse and complex interactions with no uniform trend, signaling opportunities for targeted improvements and optimizations in the logistics network.
