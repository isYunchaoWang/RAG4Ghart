The analysis of sports and entertainment reveals a distinct trend where metrics are generally highest in basketball and decline progressively across other categories, reaching their lowest in tennis. Maximum values, reaching up to 0.75, occur predominantly in the basketball category, while minimum values around 0.17 are found in tennis. Overall, there is a consistent decreasing trend from basketball through to tennis, suggesting a systematic decline across all parameters assessed. Notably, attendance and fan engagement start higher but show significant drops beyond the gaming category, indicating critical areas for potential strategic focus in lower-performing sectors.
