The risk assessment data for Human Resources and Employee Management demonstrates a gradual decreasing trend across all parameters from Compensation to Workplace Safety. The highest risk levels are observed in Leadership, particularly in the Compensation category with a maximum value of 0.77, while the lowest risk is noted in Turnover under Workplace Safety at 0.18. The overall average risk level across all parameters is approximately 0.45. Notably, the greatest risk reduction occurs consistently as we move from left to right, indicating initially high risks that gradually taper off, suggesting a structured and potentially effective risk management effort in later assessment areas.
