In contrast, dimensions like Accessibility and Adoption show more moderate and fluctuating levels. A notable pattern is the consistently high Influence value for Travel, indicating its broad impact across several areas.

This indicates a diverse cultural dynamic where preservation and popularity are prioritized, while areas such as accessibility could benefit from increased attention.
