The analysis of energy and utilities reveals a gradual decline in levels across all sectors from Coal to Water. Consumption consistently shows the highest levels, peaking at 0.94 under Distribution, while Technology exhibits the lowest levels, particularly under Water at 0.14. The overall trend demonstrates a general decrease with Consumption and Efficiency having the highest initial values and Technology and Storage showing the most significant declines. There are noticeable turning points, particularly in Policy and Technology, suggesting potential areas for improvement. The data indicates that while consumption remains relatively high, there's a critical need to advance technology and infrastructure to support sustainable growth.
