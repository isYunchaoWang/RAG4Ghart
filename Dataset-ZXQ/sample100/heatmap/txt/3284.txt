The risk assessment data for energy and utilities highlight that 'Reliability' consistently reports the highest levels across all sectors, with a maximum risk level of 0.84. Conversely, 'Consumption' shows the lowest risk levels, with a minimum value of 0.20. The overall data suggest stability, with a slight indication of higher risks associated with 'Policy' and 'Production'. The assessment reflects a trend where infrastructure and technology maintain moderate risks. The most significant growth is observed in the 'Policy' and 'Production' areas. No abrupt turning points are evident, indicating a consistent risk pattern across sectors. This suggests a need for attention and management focus on 'Reliability' and 'Policy' to mitigate potential high-risk areas effectively.
