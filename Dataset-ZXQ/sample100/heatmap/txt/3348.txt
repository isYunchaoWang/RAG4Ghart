The analysis of the correlation matrix for energy and utilities reveals several insights. The strongest positive correlation is observed between "Policy" and "Water" (1.00), suggesting a direct influence. "Investment" and "Nuclear" (0.99) also show a high correlation, implying significant investment interest in nuclear energy. Conversely, "Investment" and "Coal" have the weakest correlation (0.03), indicating minimal investment synergy. The overall trend exhibits stable patterns with occasional high correlations, with no pronounced growth or decline. These findings highlight critical areas for policy focus and potential investment opportunities, especially in nuclear energy and water management.
