The chart illustrates the relationship between research funding and publication count in science and engineering, factoring in the research team size. A diverse range of funding is evident across teams, with publication counts varying significantly. The maximum publication count reaches above 100 for lower funding levels, while the greatest concentration of publications occurs with moderate funding. A notable cluster appears around funding levels of 0.4 to 0.8 ($1e7), where team sizes also vary but include the largest observed size of 50. This suggests that a moderate level of funding, possibly with larger teams, might optimize publication output. The trend does not show a simple linear relationship between funding and publication count, indicating other influencing factors such as team size play a crucial role.
