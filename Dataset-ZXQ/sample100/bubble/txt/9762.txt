The analysis of transportation and logistics data suggests a positive correlation between traffic volume and on-time rate, displaying an overall increasing trend. Despite early fluctuations, particularly among older vehicles, the trend stabilizes, indicating improved performance in higher traffic conditions. Significant growth is observed in newer vehicles, which maintain better on-time rates across varying volumes. A key turning point occurs as traffic exceeds 6000 vehicles/hour, where performance accelerates toward maximum efficiency. This trend highlights the impact of vehicle age on logistics efficiency, especially in high-traffic scenarios.
