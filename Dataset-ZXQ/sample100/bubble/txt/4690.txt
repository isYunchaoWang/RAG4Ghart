The chart illustrates the relationship between medical costs and recovery rates, with bubble sizes indicating the number of hospital stays. The maximum recovery rate approaches 90% at a relatively high medical cost, while the minimum is around 60% at a lower cost. The total trend suggests a mild increase in recovery rate with higher medical expenses. The overall shape reveals fluctuations without a clear linear pattern. A turning point occurs at moderate medical costs with varied recovery outcomes. Significant growth in recovery rates is not directly associated with a comparable increase in costs, implying factors beyond expense impact recovery. This analysis highlights complex dynamics between healthcare spending and patient recovery.
