The chart illustrates the relationship between weekly study hours and academic performance, varying by class size. The data reveals a peak academic performance of 80 with 40 study hours while the lowest performance is around 10 with less than 5 study hours per week. The study hours range from approximately 0 to 40, with scores spanning from 10 to 80. Generally, there is a positive correlation, indicating that increased study hours tend to improve academic scores. Notable growth occurs roughly between 20 to 40 study hours, suggesting a relevant impact on performance beyond moderate hours. No clear linear pattern is discernible, but rather a gradual increase in performance with notable improvements at higher study hour intervals.
