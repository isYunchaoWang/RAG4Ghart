The chart illustrates the interaction between infrastructure age and reliability rate, with bubble sizes representing average energy consumption. Maximum reliability is around 100% with minimal infrastructure age, linked to lower energy consumption (e.g., 100kWh/month). In contrast, higher energy consumption (10.0k kWh/month) is noted with older infrastructure, correlating with lower reliability (~90%). The data indicates a generally decreasing trend in reliability with increasing infrastructure age, though fluctuations are present. Significant points include high reliability at low infrastructure ages and minimal energy usage, suggesting newer infrastructure supports better reliability.
