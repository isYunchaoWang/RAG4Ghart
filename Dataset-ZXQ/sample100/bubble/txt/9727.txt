The data presents a complex relationship between traffic volume, vehicle age, and on-time rate. Overall, the on-time rate fluctuates between 70% and 100% as traffic volume increases from 0 to just over 10,000 vehicles per hour. The vehicle age, ranging from 0.1 to 20 years, appears to influence performance, with newer vehicles typically achieving higher on-time rates. The trend is not distinctly linear but demonstrates variation influenced by vehicle age. Significant points include a high on-time rate of nearly 100% at low traffic volumes with younger vehicles, while older vehicles perform less efficiently with higher traffic volumes. This dynamic suggests a nuanced interplay between these factors, impacting transportation and logistics efficacy.
