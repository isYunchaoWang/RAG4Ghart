The analysis of the chart data reveals that the on-time rate generally decreases as traffic volume increases. The maximum on-time rate is observed at lower traffic volumes and decreases steadily with an increase in traffic, indicating a decreasing trend. There is no notable linear growth or sudden fluctuation; the trend is mostly stable with a gradual decline. A significant turning point is observed where the highest increase in traffic volume coincides with the lowest on-time rate, emphasizing the impact of vehicle age and traffic density on on-time performance. Overall, the data suggests that older vehicles in high-volume traffic significantly reduce the efficiency reflected in on-time rates.
