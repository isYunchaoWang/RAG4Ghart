The chart illustrates a positive correlation between the age of infrastructure and reliability rates, showing an overall increasing trend. The reliability rate starts around 90% for the youngest infrastructure and approaches 98% for the oldest, displaying a non-linear yet generally upward pattern. A significant observation is the increase in reliability with increasing infrastructure age, marked by fluctuations possibly influenced by varying average energy consumption levels. Notably, the largest bubbles, representing higher energy consumption, tend to appear in the middle range of both age and reliability metrics. This data suggests that as infrastructure matures, reliability generally improves, although specific points show variability due to differing energy demands.
