The chart illustrates the relationship between menu price and sales volume in the food and beverage industry, with bubble sizes representing the number of restaurant locations. The maximum sales volume recorded is approximately 10,000 units/day, while the minimum is substantially lower. The data points suggest a general trend where sales volume decreases as menu prices increase, indicating a negative correlation. The highest growth in sales volume is evident at lower price points. Notable turning points are seen where changes in price lead to significant shifts in sales volume. The variability suggests that strategic pricing is critical to maximizing sales and expanding restaurant reach.
