The analysis of the interaction between tourism and hospitality reveals a varied distribution of customer satisfaction and tourist reviews, corresponding to the daily online booking volume. The key finding is that higher tourist review ratings tend to be associated with higher customer satisfaction. The data points show a positive trend in satisfaction as reviews increase, though this relationship is not strictly linear due to fluctuations. The highest booking volume is observed at a moderate satisfaction and review level, indicating that optimal satisfaction might not always correspond with peak booking volumes. This suggests potential areas for improving customer experience to align satisfaction with increased booking volumes further.
