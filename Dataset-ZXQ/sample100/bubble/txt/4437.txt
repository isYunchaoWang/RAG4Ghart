The chart illustrates the relationship between life expectancy and age, alongside the number of patients treated. Life expectancy generally varies between 65 to 90 years across different age groups. The data points reveal that the highest number of patients treated is at an older age with significant life expectancy, peaking at 879.58 patients. Conversely, the minimum is at 10 patients in a younger age bracket with lower life expectancy. No straightforward trend in life expectancy relative to age is evident, suggesting fluctuations rather than a linear progression. Significant attention should be given to the cluster of higher patient numbers as they indicate areas with potentially higher healthcare demands.
