The analysis of tourism and hospitality data reveals a complex relationship between hotel room prices and occupancy rates. The maximum occupancy rate approaches 100% at a mid-range price around $150, with the highest bubble indicating larger hotels possibly benefiting from economies of scale. Conversely, higher-priced rooms around $400-$500 generally show moderate to lower occupancy rates, suggesting a potential threshold for pricing. The data indicates no clear linear trend, but rather peaks and fluctuations influenced by both price and hotel size. The highest growth in occupancy occurs in the price range of $100-$150, suggesting this as a potentially lucrative pricing strategy. Overall, a balanced price strategy considering both market demand and room availability appears crucial for optimizing occupancy.
