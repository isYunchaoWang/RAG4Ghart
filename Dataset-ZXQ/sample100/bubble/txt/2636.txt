The chart illustrates the relationship between school funding per student and graduation rates, with varied total student enrollments. The graduation rate ranges from 50% to 100%, while school funding ranges from $2,500 to $22,500 per student. The data shows no consistent linear trend between funding and graduation rates, indicating fluctuations. A notable cluster with high graduation rates appears around $10,000-$15,000 funding, particularly impacting smaller enrollments. A significant turning point in funding effectiveness on graduation rates is observed near $15,000, where the increased funding correlates with lower graduation rates for larger enrollments. This suggests that beyond a certain funding level, the efficiency of funding may decrease, particularly in larger schools.
