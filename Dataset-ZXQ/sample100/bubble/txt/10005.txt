The analysis of the transportation and logistics data reveals diverse trends in on-time performance relative to traffic volume and vehicle age. On-time rates range from about 70% to 100%, with traffic volumes spanning from 0 to nearly 10,000 vehicles per hour. Notably, newer vehicles, indicated by smaller bubble sizes, generally show higher on-time rates despite varying traffic conditions. The highest on-time rate is observed at low traffic volume with newer vehicles, while older vehicles exhibit reduced on-time rates as traffic volume increases. This suggests a declining trend in performance with both increased vehicle age and traffic volume, highlighting the critical role of maintaining newer fleets to enhance efficiency.
