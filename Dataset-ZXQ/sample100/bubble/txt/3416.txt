The analysis of the "Correlation of Energy and Utilities" chart shows a positive correlation between production capacity and efficiency score. The highest efficiency score observed is 96% at a production capacity around 0.7 million MW. The lowest is about 76% at roughly 1 million MW. The average efficiency score sits around 86%, with a total production span ranging from 0 to 1.1 million MW. Overall, the trend demonstrates growth in efficiency with increased capacity, although some fluctuations are present. Significant increases in efficiency are observed at lower production capacities, with a notable clustering between 0.5 to 0.7 million MW, where efficiency is highest.
