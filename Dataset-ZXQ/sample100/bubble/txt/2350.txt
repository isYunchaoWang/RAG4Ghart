The chart examines the relationship between school funding per student and graduation rates, with data points representing varying student enrollments. Graduation rates generally increase with higher funding, though there is notable variability at different points of funding and enrollment sizes. The trend suggests a positive correlation, particularly with some outliers showing high graduation rates at both lower and higher funding levels. The overall trend is neither strictly linear nor stable, indicating growth with fluctuations. Larger enrollments tend to cluster around mid graduation rates, while both low and high funding levels exhibit higher rates, suggesting other influencing factors. Identifying turning points shows that funding increases often correspond to higher graduation rates, although some anomalies exist.
