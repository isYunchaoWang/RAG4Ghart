The analysis of the tourism and hospitality data reveals diverse trends in customer satisfaction and tourist reviews. Ratings for customer satisfaction vary widely, ranging from 1.5 to 5, while tourist reviews are spread from 1 to 5. The bubble sizes, representing daily online bookings, range significantly, with the minimum being 0.1 and the maximum reaching 1,000. On average, booking volumes appear modest when considered across the dataset. The overall trend shows no linear growth or decline; instead, it displays a scattered pattern with fluctuations and isolated peaks. The largest booking volume is associated with an average satisfaction rating, indicating that high volumes do not always correlate with the highest satisfaction. Notably, no major turning points in trends are evident. This analysis suggests that while customer engagement varies, volume does not consistently align with satisfaction metrics, presenting an opportunity for targeted improvements in areas with lower satisfaction scores.
