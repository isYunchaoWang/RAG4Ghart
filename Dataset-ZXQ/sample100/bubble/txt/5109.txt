The chart illustrates a positive correlation between years of experience and salary in Human Resources and Employee Management, with salaries generally increasing as experience grows. The maximum salary exceeds $200,000, while the minimum is just under $50,000. The average salary appears to trend upwards significantly after around 20 years of experience, displaying a non-linear growth pattern with acceleration in salary growth at higher experience levels. A notable increase occurs particularly after 20 years, possibly indicating a turning point where experience substantially influences salary. The majority of larger team sizes correspond with higher salaries and greater years of experience, reinforcing the trend of increasing reward with experience.
