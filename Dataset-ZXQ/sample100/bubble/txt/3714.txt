The chart reveals diverse patterns in the food and beverage industry's relation between ingredient costs and profit margins. The profit margin ranges from a maximum of about 65% to a minimum close to 5%, with a notable cluster between 40% and 60%. Ingredient costs show an increase from low to higher values, with an evident negative correlation between cost and profit margin. Most items have costs below $5, with a few exceptions rising above this range. Notably, the average customer order frequency shows significant variation, influencing the size of the bubble representation. This suggests that higher customer frequency correlates with lower ingredient costs and higher profit margins, indicating potential strategic pricing leverage for industry stakeholders.
