The chart illustrates occupancy rates against the price per night and hotel size, revealing a varied pattern. Occupancy rates display a range from approximately 60% to 100%, with prices varying up to $400 per night. Large hotels, shown by bubble size, do not consistently correlate with higher occupancy. Notably, hotels with mid-range pricing ($200-$300) exhibit higher occupancy regardless of size, indicating a potential preference for moderate pricing. There is no clear linear trend, but rather a scattered distribution with a higher concentration of high occupancy in the mid-price range. This indicates a balanced demand across varying prices, barring extreme high costs.
