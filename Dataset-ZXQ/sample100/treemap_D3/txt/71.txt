In the 2020 science distribution by category, the data shows the largest proportion in "Algorithms" at 16.16%, while "Brain Function" represents the smallest category at 5.12%. The total distribution percentage across all categories equals 100%, with an average of approximately 8.33%. The chart indicates no significant trend direction as it represents categorical data for a single year rather than a time series. However, notable insights include the relatively balanced spread among categories, with "Algorithms," "Ecology," and "Neural Networks" comprising the top three categories. There are no evident turning points or growth rates to analyze, given the static nature of a single year's categorical presentation.
