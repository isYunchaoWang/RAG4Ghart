In 2021, educational distribution across various categories shows a diverse landscape. Doctoral programs hold the largest share at 12.64%, followed by public libraries at 12.21%. The smallest category is liberal arts colleges at 5.05%. The average distribution across all categories is approximately 8.31%. There is no evident overarching trend since the data pertains to categorical distribution for a single year. However, doctoral programs and public libraries significantly outperform others, indicating higher resource allocation or attendance. No turning points are identifiable due to a lack of temporal data. Overall, the distribution highlights the dominant roles of advanced education and public library services within the educational sector for this period.
