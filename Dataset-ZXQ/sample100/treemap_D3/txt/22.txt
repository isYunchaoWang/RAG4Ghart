In 2021, the distribution of education by category showed a varied spread.

The lowest percentages were found in Liberal Arts Colleges (5.05%) and Public Primary education (5.84%). The data implies a concentration in advanced and public educational services. The lack of a clear trend or significant growth spikes suggests a stable distribution across categories, with no single type experiencing explosive growth or decline.
