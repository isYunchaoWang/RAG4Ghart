In the 2022 housing market distribution, the largest categories are "Houses for Rent" and "Shopping Centers," each with over 21% of the market share. The smallest category is "Office Buildings" at 5.02%. The data reveals a diverse distribution across categories, with no single dominating trend. However, residential categories, combining "Houses for Rent," "Apartments," "Short-Term Rentals," and "Duplex," comprise a significant portion of the market. The stability in distribution suggests a balanced market approach to both residential and commercial property allocations.
