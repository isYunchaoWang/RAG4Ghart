In 2024, energy distribution is predominantly led by manufacturing and mining, representing 16.04% and 15.76% respectively, followed by contributions from thermal plants at 12.51% and solar energy at 11.55%. The lowest contributions come from smart grids, high voltage lines, wind, coal, and oil, each hovering around 5-6%. While there's no evident trend since the data represents a single snapshot year, the significant varying percentages imply a diverse energy reliance with a substantial emphasis on industrial categories. Notably, renewable sources such as solar and hydropower play an important role as compared to traditional energy sources like oil and coal.
