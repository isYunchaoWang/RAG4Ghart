The electricity demand from 1957 to 1984 exhibited a consistent upward trend. Starting from a minimum of slightly above 2.5 billion MWh in 1957, demand increased steadily to a peak of nearly 7 billion MWh by 1984. The growth pattern was characterized by a linear increase with periods of acceleration around the mid-1960s and early 1980s. This trend was driven by cumulative contributions from Azure Energy Distribution, Zenith Utility Services, and the Meridian Energy Network. Notably, each segment experienced steady growth without significant fluctuations or turning points, indicating stable increases in aggregated electricity demand over this period. The overall growth is indicative of expanding energy consumption needs across the timeline.
