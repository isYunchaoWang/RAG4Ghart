Between 1953 and 1957, research funding for the five institutions experienced steady and consistent growth, with an upward linear trend observed throughout the period. The total funding increased notably from just over $2 million in 1953 to approximately $3 million in 1957. Each institution contributed to this aggregate increase, with no significant turning points in growth rates. This indicates a stable investment in research across the board, with a consistent rise in financial support over the five-year duration.
