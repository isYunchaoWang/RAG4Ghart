From 1953 to 1965, faculty satisfaction across the three institutions shows a gradual decrease. The total satisfaction percentage is consistently between 200% to 250%. The trend is generally stable, with a slight decline over the years. Zenith Institute of Technology, Silverhaven Polytechnic, and Celestial College all reflect this downward trajectory with minimal fluctuations. Despite the overall consistency in trends between the institutions, the slight downtrend may suggest a common challenge affecting faculty satisfaction across the board during this period.
