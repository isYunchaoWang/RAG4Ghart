The analysis of training hours per employee from 2009 to 2024 reveals an overall increasing trend. Initially, from 2009 to 2016, there is a slight decline followed by stabilization. However, starting from 2017, there is a notable upward trajectory, with a marked increase after 2020, culminating in the highest levels projected for 2024. The data depicts a growth pattern characterized by fluctuations early on, leading to linear growth in recent years. The most significant increase occurs between 2020 and 2024, suggesting a strategic emphasis on enhancing employee training across various departments, particularly within the Operations Staff. This shift likely reflects organizational changes or a response to evolving business needs.
