Between 1960 and 1984, the chart indicates a consistent decline in daily active users for both NovaStream and OracleFeed. Starting with a combined user base over 2 billion in 1960, the numbers demonstrate a clear downward trend, reaching near negligible levels by the early 1980s. The decline appears relatively linear with occasional fluctuations, but the overall trajectory is negative. No significant periods of growth are visible; instead, minor upticks in users are immediately followed by further declines, suggesting no lasting turning points or recoveries throughout these years.
