From 2001 to 2005, the overall crop yield across the analyzed farms exhibited a decreasing trend. The initial total crop yield was at its maximum in 2001, and it steadily declined over the years, reaching a minimum by 2005. This decline was linear in nature, without significant fluctuations or turning points. Each farm, including Sunstone Farms, Ironwood Ranch, Starfall Organics, Whispering Willows Estate, and Misty Meadow Acres, contributed to this overall decrease, with no single event or farm showing a sharp change in growth rate. The average yield over the period was consistent with the downward trend.
