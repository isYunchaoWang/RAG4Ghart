From 1981 to 2005, the total livestock production experienced a steady increase, culminating in a marked growth by the end of the period. The data exhibits a linear upward trend, with no significant fluctuations or turning points, indicating consistent growth across the years. The maximum production is observed in 2005, while the minimum is recorded in 1981. This growth is primarily driven by Golden Harvest Cooperative, which shows the largest proportional increase in production contributions, followed by Whispering Willows Estate. The results highlight a robust expansion in livestock production capabilities over the 24-year span.
