From 1991 to 2014, the average room price for glamping sites and ski lodges exhibited an overall increasing trend. Initially stable with mild fluctuations, a period of accelerated growth occurred post-2007, indicating a notable upward trajectory. Although prices for glamping sites decreased slightly over the period, the significant rise in ski lodge prices drove the overall increase. The sharp incline post-2007 marks a distinct turning point in price escalation, attributed primarily to ski lodges.
