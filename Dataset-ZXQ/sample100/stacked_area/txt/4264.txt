The chart illustrates a declining trend in vaccination rates from 2003 to 2015 across all sectors. The total vaccination rate begins at just over 400% in 2003 and steadily decreases to approximately 300% by 2015, reflecting a consistent downward trajectory. The decline appears relatively linear with no significant fluctuations or turning points, suggesting a uniform decrease. The most substantial reduction is observed in the Crimson Quarter, followed by consistent decreases in Azure Enclave, Verdant Ward, District Alpha, and Sector Beta. This steady decline across all sectors indicates a persistent and overall reduction in vaccination rates over the period analyzed.
