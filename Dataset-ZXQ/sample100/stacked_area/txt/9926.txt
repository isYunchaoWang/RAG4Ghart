From 1964 to 1974, the overall on-time delivery rate experienced a general decline. Initially peaking around 1965, the rate gradually decreased over the subsequent years. The data depict a pattern of steady decline rather than sudden fluctuations, suggesting systemic factors may have contributed to this trend. The combined rates for Pharmaceuticals, E-Commerce Parcels, and Automotive Parts all contribute to this shift, with no significant turning points observed. The declining trend appears consistent, indicating potential areas for process improvement in delivery efficiencies over time.
