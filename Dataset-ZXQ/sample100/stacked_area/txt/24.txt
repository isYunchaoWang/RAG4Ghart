From 2000 to 2016, the crop yield experienced consistent growth across all farms. The total yield value increased from approximately 300,000 tons/hectare in 2000 to over 700,000 tons/hectare by 2016. This indicates a substantial growth rate over the 16-year period, characterized by steady increases each year without any major fluctuations or turning points. The growth is primarily driven by expansions in output from Sunstone Farms and Whispering Willows Estate, which contributed significantly to the upward trend. Overall, the data suggests a positive and stable increase in crop productivity.
