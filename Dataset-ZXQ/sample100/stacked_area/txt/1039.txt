The operating expenses from 1964 to 1992 show a general increasing trend, characterized by linear growth with minor fluctuations. Starting from approximately $30 million in 1964, expenses reached nearly $36 million by 1992. The overall trend is upward with a significant growth spurt evident in the late 1980s. The highest individual segment increase appears to be from Horizon Enterprises, contributing notably to the upward trajectory in the later years. A slight downturn occurs in the mid-1980s, followed by recovery and continued growth, indicating resilience and expansion over the nearly three-decade period.
