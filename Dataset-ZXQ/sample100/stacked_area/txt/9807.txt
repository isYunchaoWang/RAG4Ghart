Between 1979 and 1986, driver satisfaction experienced an overall increase, characterized by periods of fluctuation. The index rose steadily with some variability, peaking in 1985. The significant growth was observed between 1984 and 1985, particularly in the categories of Long-Haul Operators and Drone Pilots. The consistent upward trend with a noticeable rise towards the later years indicates a generally positive trajectory in driver satisfaction during this period.
