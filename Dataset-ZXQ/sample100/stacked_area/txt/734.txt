Between 1967 and 1977, the overall customer acquisition cost across Ironclad Ventures, Vanguard Dynamics, Apex Systems, and Horizon Enterprises witnessed a gradual increase. This trend exhibits fluctuations, most notably a slight dip around 1971-1973, followed by a more marked rise towards the end of the period. The costs increased from slightly over $300 in 1967 to just above $500 by 1977. The steadiness in this upward trajectory points to significant growth in customer acquisition expenses, with the most substantial rise occurring post-1975.
