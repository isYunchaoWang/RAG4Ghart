From 1971 to 1991, the total number of engineering graduates steadily increased from around 6,000 to approximately 10,000 students. The trend shows a gradual rise followed by a more pronounced increase toward the late 1980s and early 1990s. Initial years show stability with minor fluctuations, but significant growth occurs post-1985, indicating a turning point. Among the institutions, Aether University contributed significantly to this growth. The overall pattern resembles a slow linear growth initially, transitioning to an acceleration towards the end of the period.
