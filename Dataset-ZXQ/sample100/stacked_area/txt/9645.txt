The chart depicts a consistent increase in cargo shipments from 1991 to 2011, with a general trend of growth that appears steady yet slightly fluctuating. The growth is notably linear, with several minor fluctuations, especially around the early 2000s, leading to significant upward trends toward the end of the period. The shipments started below 400,000 tons/month in 1991, eventually peaking above 800,000 tons/month in 2011. The most substantial growth rates were seen in the latter years, particularly from 2009 to 2011, indicating an acceleration in shipment volume. Noteworthy turning points are observed around the mid-1990s and early 2000s, where shifts in growth patterns occur. Overall, the data suggests a robust expansion in cargo shipments, with periods of rapid growth highlighting significant developments in the logistics and transportation sectors.
