The carbon emissions from 1950 to 1966 show a consistent increasing trend, with the total emissions rising steadily over the years. The maximum emissions occur in 1966, while the minimum is seen in 1950. On average, emissions have shown growth, underlining a clear upward trajectory. The trend exhibits a linear growth pattern with no significant fluctuations. Notably, the largest growth rate appears to occur towards the latter years of the data set, indicating an acceleration in emissions. These insights highlight a continual and significant increase in carbon emissions during the observed period.
