The analysis of the relationship between fertilizer usage and product freshness reveals a clear positive trend. As fertilizer usage increases, product freshness ratings steadily rise, starting at around 1.0 and reaching up to 5.0. This trend is largely linear with some initial fluctuations before stabilizing into more consistent growth at higher levels of fertilizer application. The data suggests a strong correlation between increased fertilizer usage and enhanced product freshness, indicating that higher fertilizer application is associated with fresher agricultural products.
