The analysis of the chart reveals a positive correlation between GDP growth and investment rate, with both variables increasing together. The trend shows a pronounced acceleration in investment rate corresponding to higher GDP growth, following a nonlinear upwards trajectory. The data displays its lowest values at negative GDP growth percentages and minimal investment rates, while peaking at the highest GDP growth with substantial investment rates. The curve indicates a smooth escalation with no significant turning points, suggesting the relationship strengthens with increasing GDP growth. This pattern reflects how economic expansion may drive heightened investment activities.
