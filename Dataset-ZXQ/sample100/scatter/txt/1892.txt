The data represents a parabolic trend in carbon footprint relative to infrastructure age, with a notable peak around mid-life (approximately 25 years). The carbon footprint increases from around 5 tons CO2e/year at the beginning of the infrastructure's life, reaching a maximum of just over 50 tons CO2e/year before declining back toward the lower 10s by year 50. This suggests a phenomenon where mid-aged infrastructure is most carbon-intensive, likely due to efficiency decline and maintenance needs, whereas newer and older infrastructures have lower associated carbon footprints. The overall trend depicts a symmetrical rise and fall, with the steepest growth and decline occurring in the first and last 10-year periods respectively.
