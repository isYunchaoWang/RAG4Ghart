The analysis of the chart data shows a clear decreasing trend in occupancy rate as the seasonality index increases. Initially, there is a sharp decline from nearly 100% to around 50% occupancy rate, suggesting high variability depending on the time of year. As the index progresses, the occupancy rate stabilizes but remains lower, fluctuating between 40% and 60%. These fluctuations indicate ongoing variations even after the initial sharp drop. There are no notable turning points or periods of rapid growth, indicating a consistent seasonal pattern in tourism and hospitality occupancy rates.
