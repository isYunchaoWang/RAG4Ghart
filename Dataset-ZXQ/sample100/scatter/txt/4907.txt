The scatter plot illustrating the relationship between website traffic and customer lifetime value reveals no clear linear trend, indicating a relatively stable relationship without significant directional growth or decline. While variations exist, with customer lifetime values ranging up to $5000 with varying degrees of traffic, there is no consistent pattern of increase or decrease plainly visible. The data is characterized by fluctuation rather than trend shifts, and no significant turning points are observed. This suggests that factors influencing customer lifetime value may not be strongly tied to website traffic alone.
