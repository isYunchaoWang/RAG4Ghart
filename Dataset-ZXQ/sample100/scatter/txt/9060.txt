The chart illustrates that as attraction popularity increases, there is a general decreasing trend in occupancy rate, starting from around 100% and declining towards 30%. The trend is not linear but shows fluctuations with some stabilization at lower popularity levels. This indicates a potential inverse relationship where less popular attractions achieve higher occupancy rates, possibly due to lower overall capacity or niche appeal. No significant growth spurts or turning points are evident within the dataset, implying a consistent trend over the observed period.
