Based on the provided chart data, there is no clear overall trend linking pollution levels and air quality, as the data points are widely scattered. The air quality index values range from a minimum to a maximum without consistent patterns, suggesting significant variability. There are no distinct turning points or linear growth patterns, indicating that changes in pollution levels are not directly correlated with significant changes in air quality within the observed data. Consequently, this suggests that other factors might influence air quality independently of the pollution index.
