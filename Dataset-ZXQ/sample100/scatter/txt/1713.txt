The data shows a clear parabolic trend between grid stability and customer outage duration. Initially, as grid stability increases, outage duration rises, reaching a peak before decreasing as stability continues to improve. The highest outage duration occurs around the midpoint of the stability index, indicating significant disruptions at moderate stability levels. This pattern suggests the presence of an underlying factor affecting both stability and outage duration, with improved stability eventually leading to reduced outage durations.
