The data demonstrates a U-shaped trend between stock price and exchange rate. Initially, as stock prices increase, the exchange rate decreases, reaching a minimum point. After this inflection point, further increases in stock price correlate with rising exchange rates. This reflects a parabolic trend, indicating that exchange rates decrease to a certain threshold before rebounding as stock prices continue to increase. The turning point marks significant shifts in financial dynamics, signifying potential opportunities or risks in economic strategies.
