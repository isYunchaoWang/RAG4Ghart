The chart illustrates a U-shaped relationship between irrigation amount and livestock health. Initially, as irrigation increases from low levels, livestock health declines to a minimum, after which further increases in irrigation correspond to an improvement in health ratings. The lowest health rating is observed around moderate irrigation levels, while the highest health ratings occur at both low and high irrigation levels, indicating a non-linear dynamic that suggests optimal and suboptimal irrigation thresholds for maintaining livestock health.
