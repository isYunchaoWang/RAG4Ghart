The data exhibits a parabolic trend in e-commerce sales versus data usage. The sales start at a high value with low data usage, decrease to a minimum around mid-range data usage, and then increase again as data usage continues to rise. This indicates a U-shaped pattern with the maximum sales occurring at the extremes of low and high data usage, while the minimum sales are found at a moderate data usage level. The highest growth rate is noticed as data usage moves away from the mid-range towards the higher end. This suggests that both minimal and extensive data usage are associated with higher e-commerce activities, possibly indicating different consumer behaviors and preferences at these levels.
