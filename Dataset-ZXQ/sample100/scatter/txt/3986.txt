The data reveals a decreasing trend in readmission rates as patient age increases. Initially, there is a high readmission rate for younger patients, peaking at around 30%. As age progresses, the readmission rate declines, with some fluctuations, stabilizing at around 5% to 10% for older patients. No significant turning points are observed, but the overall trend suggests a downward linear pattern in readmission rates with increasing age.
