The chart illustrates a U-shaped relationship between crop yield and forest cover percentage. Crop yield is highest at both low and high percentages of forest cover, reaching around 10 tons/hectare, while values decrease to a minimum of about 2 tons/hectare at mid-range forest cover between 40% and 60%. The trend shows decreasing yield from low to mid-range forest cover, then increasing yield towards higher forest cover. This suggests crop productivity benefits are maximized at forest cover extremes, with a notable dip in yield at moderate cover levels.
