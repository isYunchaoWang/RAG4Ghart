The chart demonstrates a strong positive correlation between household income and literacy rate. As income increases from $25,000 to $200,000, literacy rates tend to rise from approximately 70% to close to 100%. The trend is generally linear with some fluctuations. No significant turning points are evident, indicating consistent growth without sharp increases or decreases. Overall, higher household incomes are associated with higher literacy rates, suggesting an upward trend in educational attainment with increased financial resources.
