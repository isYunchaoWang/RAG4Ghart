The analysis shows a clear upward trend in foot traffic as product prices increase, indicating a positive correlation between price and consumer engagement. The relationship suggests an exponential growth pattern, with more significant increases in foot traffic at higher price points, reflecting non-linear growth after initial fluctuations at lower price ranges. This trend implies that higher-priced products attract more consumer interest, which could indicate perceived value or prestige associated with such products. There are no distinct turning points, suggesting consistency in consumer behavior across the entire price spectrum.
