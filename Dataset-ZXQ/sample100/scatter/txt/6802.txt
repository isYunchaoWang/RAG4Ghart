The data depicts an initial increase in sales volume as checkout time rises, peaking around 4 minutes, followed by a decline thereafter. This represents a bell-shaped trend illustrating heightened consumer engagement and sales efficiency around the mid-range of checkout times. There is a significant growth in sales volume initially, reaching a maximum before declining, with the most notable shift occurring after the peak. This pattern suggests that optimizing checkout times could lead to maximal sales performance.
