The chart displays a positive correlation between blood pressure (mmHg) and survival rate (%). As blood pressure increases from approximately 80 to 180 mmHg, the survival rate shows a noticeable upward trend from about 50% to 100%. This suggests a steady and linear growth pattern without significant fluctuations or turning points. Higher blood pressure in this data set correlates with greater survival rates.
