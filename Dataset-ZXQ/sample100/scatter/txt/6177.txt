The scatter plot analysis reveals no clear linear correlation between store size and foot traffic, indicating a complex relationship between the two variables. Although the foot traffic exhibits variability across different store sizes, it does not consistently increase or decrease with store size changes. This suggests that factors other than store size might play significant roles in driving consumer behavior and foot traffic patterns. Further investigation into additional variables could provide deeper insights into what influences foot traffic in retail environments.
