The data depicts a U-shaped relationship between promotional spending and customer satisfaction ratings. Starting with high satisfaction at lower spending levels, satisfaction decreases as spending increases, reaching a minimum around the mid-range spending. Thereafter, satisfaction ratings significantly increase along with higher spending levels, returning to initial high levels. Notably, the lowest point in satisfaction occurs mid-spend, highlighting a potential inefficiency in promotional allocation. Significant growth in satisfaction is observed beyond this inflection point, suggesting that higher promotional investments are more effective in enhancing customer satisfaction.
