The data exhibits a clear parabolic trend in the relationship between irrigation amount and food production cost. The cost starts at a minimum when irrigation is minimal, increases to a maximum at moderate levels of irrigation, and then decreases as irrigation continues to rise. This indicates a non-linear, bell-shaped relationship. The maximum cost occurs in the mid-range of irrigation, suggesting inefficiencies at certain levels. There are no significant abrupt changes or turning points; instead, the shape suggests a gradual increase followed by a gradual decrease. Overall, optimal irrigation should avoid the extremes to minimize production costs.
