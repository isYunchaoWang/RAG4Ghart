The data analysis reveals a scatterplot showing the relationship between test scores and parental education in years. The test scores range from approximately 400 to 1600, reflecting a wide spread of values. There is no clear linear trend, as the data points are dispersed with some clustering observed at certain intervals. The overall distribution appears relatively stable without a consistent increasing or decreasing trend over the range of parental education years. There is a notable fluctuation in test scores, with no distinct turning points or significant growth rates detected. The absence of a definitive pattern suggests that while parental education may influence test scores, other variables could also play significant roles.
