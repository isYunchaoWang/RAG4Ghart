The chart illustrates an inverse relationship between renewable energy share and energy efficiency. As the percentage of renewable energy increases, energy efficiency tends to decrease, displaying a non-linear decline with fluctuations. The highest point of energy efficiency occurs at the lowest share of renewable energy, while the lowest efficiency is associated with higher shares of renewables. No significant turning points or rapid shifts in growth are observed, indicating a consistent trend throughout the data. Overall, increasing renewable energy share correlates with decreased energy efficiency, suggesting potential challenges in optimizing efficiency within higher renewable portfolios.
