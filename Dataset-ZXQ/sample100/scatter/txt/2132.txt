The chart illustrates a parabolic relationship between pollution level and air quality, with air quality increasing as pollution initially rises, peaking near a pollution index of approximately 50, and then declining as pollution continues to increase. The air quality index reaches its maximum value at the peak and minimum value at both low and high pollution levels. The overall trend depicts a bell-shaped curve, indicating the presence of a turning point at the peak pollution level. This pattern suggests that past a certain threshold, increased pollution inversely affects air quality, highlighting the critical need for controlling pollution levels to maintain optimal air quality.
