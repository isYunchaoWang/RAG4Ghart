The analysis of the chart data suggests a negative correlation between team size and productivity. As team size increases from 2 to 20 people, productivity generally decreases, showcasing a downward trend. The trend initially has a steep decline, which becomes more stabilized with minor fluctuations as team sizes continue to expand. There is no significant turning point where the trend reverses, but the steepest decline occurs in smaller team sizes. Overall, the data indicates that smaller teams are associated with higher productivity indices, which decline as team size increases.
