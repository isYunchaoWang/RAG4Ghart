The analysis of the data reveals significant variability in soil quality as sunlight hours per day increase. There is no clear linear trend, as soil quality indices fluctuate widely between 4 and 12 sunlight hours. The maximum soil quality index is observed around the mid-range of sunlight hours, while the minimum occurs at both low and high ends of the sunlight scale. Overall, the data does not exhibit a consistent increasing or decreasing trend but rather shows a scattered pattern with potential local peaks. The absence of significant correlations suggests that factors other than sunlight hours might be influencing soil quality.
