The chart illustrates a U-shaped curve where e-commerce sales initially decrease as internet speed increases until reaching a minimum point, after which sales increase with further increases in speed. This indicates a significant turning point around the mid-speed range. Maximum sales occur at both low and high extremes of internet speed, while minimum sales are present at mid-speeds. The trend suggests that both very low and very high internet speeds are associated with higher e-commerce performance.
