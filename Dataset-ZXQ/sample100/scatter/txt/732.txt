The chart illustrates a U-shaped relationship between school funding per student and literacy rates. Initially, as funding decreases from the higher end, literacy rates drop, reaching a minimum before beginning to rise again after a certain funding threshold. This suggests that both very low and very high levels of funding correlate with higher literacy rates, whereas funding at intermediate levels appears to be less effective. There are no abrupt turning points, but a gradual decline followed by a rise as funding increases. The trend indicates potential inefficiencies in middle-tier funding strategies, emphasizing the importance of optimizing educational investments.
