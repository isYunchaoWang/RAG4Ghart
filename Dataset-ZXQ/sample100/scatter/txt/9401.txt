The scatter plot demonstrates a wide range of customer review scores (1 to 5) across varying hotel prices ($100 to $1000 per night). The data does not exhibit a clear trend, indicating that hotel price does not strongly correlate with review scores. Customer ratings appear to be distributed randomly across the price spectrum, with both high and low scores found at all price levels. There are no distinctive turning points or significant growth patterns, suggesting that factors other than price may heavily influence customer reviews in the tourism and hospitality sector.
