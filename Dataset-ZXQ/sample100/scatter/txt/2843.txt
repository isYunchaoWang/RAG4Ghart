The chart illustrates a U-shaped relationship between GDP growth and consumer spending. The maximum consumer spending occurs at both high positive and high negative GDP growth rates, while the minimum spending is observed at moderate GDP growth rates. Consumer spending decreases as GDP growth approaches zero and increases again as GDP growth becomes positive or negative. This suggests that significant economic growth or contraction leads to higher consumer spending, possibly indicating a reactive consumer behavior to economic changes. There are no specific turning points as the trend smoothly transitions from decline to growth, forming a symmetrical U-shape.
