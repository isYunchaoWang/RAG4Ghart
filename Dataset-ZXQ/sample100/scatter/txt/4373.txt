The chart illustrates absenteeism in relation to team size, showing an initial increase in absenteeism as team size grows from about 2.5 to 10 people. After peaking, absenteeism begins to decline with larger team sizes, resulting in an inverted U-shaped trend. The highest absenteeism occurs around medium team sizes, highlighting potential increased coordination challenges. The trend suggests that an optimal team size might balance workload and manageability to minimize absenteeism.
