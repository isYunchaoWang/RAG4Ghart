The chart displays a parabolic relationship between average temperature and water quality. Water quality initially increases with temperature, peaking at around 15°„C, after which it declines sharply. This indicates an optimal temperature range for maintaining high water quality before it deteriorates as temperature rises further. There is a noticeable turning point at the peak temperature, showcasing the critical balance required to sustain environmental quality.
