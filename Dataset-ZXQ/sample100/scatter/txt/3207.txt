The chart illustrates a negative correlation between the unemployment rate (%) and business confidence (index). As unemployment rates increase from around 2.5% to 20%, business confidence generally declines from near 100 to lower levels, likely below 20. The overall trend shows a decreasing pattern with some fluctuations. No significant turning points or sharp growth segments are evident, suggesting a steady decline with minor variations. This negative trend indicates that higher unemployment correlates with decreased business confidence, potentially impacting economic dynamics.
