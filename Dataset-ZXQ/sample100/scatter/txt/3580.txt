The data demonstrates a clear trend where the survival rate initially increases as the treatment dosage increases, reaching a peak at a certain point, and then declines as the dosage continues to rise. This creates a parabolic trend suggesting optimal effectiveness at a mid-range dosage. The maximum survival rate is approximately 100%, while the minimum is around 50%. This indicates that extremely low or high dosages are less effective. Overall, the trend suggests a turning point that can be identified as a dosage range providing the highest survival rate, emphasizing the importance of dosage optimization in treatment efficacy.
