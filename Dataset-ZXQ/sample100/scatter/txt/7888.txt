The chart illustrates a decreasing trend in endurance levels as training hours increase, starting from a high of 100 and dropping progressively. The minimum endurance value appears near zero, with no notable points of reversal. The overall trend suggests a decline in endurance associated with increasing training hours, depicted as a non-linear, fluctuating decrease. A significant drop occurs early on, without any evident turning points. This relationship highlights a potential negative correlation between extensive training hours and endurance levels within the observed range.
