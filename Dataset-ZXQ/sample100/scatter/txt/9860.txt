The chart illustrates a clear decreasing trend in transport efficiency as traffic volume increases. The highest transport efficiency, approximately 95%, occurs at the lowest traffic volumes, while the efficiency drops to around 50% at the highest traffic volumes of 100,000 vehicles per day. The trend is non-linear, showing initial rapid declines followed by a gradual drop with minor fluctuations. These fluctuations indicate brief periods of efficiency improvement amidst the general decline. The analysis highlights a significant inverse relationship between traffic volume and transport efficiency, suggesting that as traffic congestion increases, transport efficiency significantly decreases.
