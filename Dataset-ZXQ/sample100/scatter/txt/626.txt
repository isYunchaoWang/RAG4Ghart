The chart illustrates the relationship between irrigation amount and soil quality, revealing a parabolic trend. Initially, soil quality improves with increased irrigation, reaching a peak, suggesting optimal irrigation levels. Beyond this point, further increases in irrigation lead to a decline in soil quality. This trend suggests an optimal irrigation range exists for maximizing soil quality. It highlights the importance of balancing irrigation to prevent degradation and maintain high soil quality.
