The analysis of the relationship between delivery time and transport efficiency reveals a distinct parabolic trend. Initially, transport efficiency increases with longer delivery times, reaching a peak around the mid-range. This suggests an optimal delivery time where efficiency is maximized. Beyond this point, efficiency declines as delivery times continue to extend. The graph highlights a clear turning point, indicative of a peak efficiency threshold. This trend showcases a rise and fall pattern, underscoring the importance of balancing delivery time to maintain optimal transport efficiency.
