From 1986 to 1999, the vaccination rate across various regions showed mild fluctuations but remained relatively stable overall. Each area's contribution to the total vaccination rate maintained a consistent presence, indicating no significant shifts in dominance. While variations were present year-to-year, no drastic upward or downward trends were observed in the overall data. This suggests a steady state of vaccination distribution across the examined period, with minor fluctuations but without notable turning points or substantial growth in any specific region.
