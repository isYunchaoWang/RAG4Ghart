From 2009 to 2021, cross-border delays showed a generally increasing trend with noticeable fluctuations. The data reveals that delays peaked around 2014 and again towards 2021, reflecting the highest increases in political disruptions and sanitary inspections. Notably, a significant rise occurred post-2018, suggesting potential influences from external geopolitical or economic factors. The most consistent growth was observed in the customs clearance and documentation errors categories. These findings underscore a need for targeted interventions to streamline these processes and reduce future delays.
