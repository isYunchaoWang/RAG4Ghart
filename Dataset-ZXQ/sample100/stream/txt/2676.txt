From 1958 to 1976, library visits exhibit a cyclical pattern with periods of growth followed by declines, indicating a fluctuating yet rising longer-term trend. The Aethelgard Art Library and Borealis Research Hub show marked fluctuations, with significant growth spurts followed by declines, particularly in the mid-to-late 1960s and early 1970s. On the other hand, the Arcane University Library shows a more stable yet slight growth over the years. The data suggests a complex interplay between these libraries, where shifts in popularity and usage likely drive the dynamic changes seen across the period. Notably, the highest lift for some libraries coincides with subsequent declines, underscoring potential influences of external factors, strategic changes, or resource allocations in the libraries' operations.
