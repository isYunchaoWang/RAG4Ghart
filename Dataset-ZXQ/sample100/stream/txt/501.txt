From 1965 to 1987, the crop yield at both Ironwood Ranch and Whispering Willows Estate showed a significant upward trend. Initially, yields were lower, but both areas experienced a steady increase over the years. The growth appears linear, with no major fluctuations or turning points, indicating consistent improvements in agricultural practices or conditions. The increase in yield is evident as both sections of the area chart expand over time, reflecting enhanced productivity in tons per hectare.
