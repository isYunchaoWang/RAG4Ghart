From 1992 to 2002, the average room price across various accommodation types demonstrated a consistent upward trend. All categories¡ªCity Center Hotels, Cruise Ships, Glamping Sites, Treehouse Retreats, Desert Camps, and Ski Lodges¡ªcontributed to the overall increase, with some fluctuation observed, particularly around the mid-1990s. The data exhibits a progressive growth pattern rather than linear, indicating variations in consumer demand and market dynamics. Notably, the most significant growth occurred between 1998 and 2002, with a marked increase in average prices. This period reflects a potential turning point where demand amplified, possibly due to economic or industry-specific changes driving room prices upward across all segments.
