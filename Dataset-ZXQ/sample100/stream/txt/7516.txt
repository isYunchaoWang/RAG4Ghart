The data depicting average watch time from 1961 to 1984 indicates a steady increase in overall watch time, with the most significant rise occurring post-1979. Initially, watch time stayed relatively stable with minor fluctuations. However, a marked upward trend became evident from the mid-1970s, culminating in peak levels by 1984. This growth trajectory was predominantly driven by increases in watch time among Premium Users, which expanded significantly compared to other user categories. The significant turning point appears to be around 1979, where growth rates for Premium and Desktop Users visibly accelerated, contributing to the overall rise in the total average watch time.
