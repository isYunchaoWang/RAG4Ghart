From 1991 to 2014, the overall luggage loss rate initially exhibited a rising trend, peaking around the early 2000s, followed by a gradual decline and stabilization. Notable fluctuations occurred, particularly between 1995 and 2005, with ferry services and bus stations showing the most volatility. Car rentals and shared rides maintained a relatively steady rate, contributing to the smoothing of the overall trend in the later years. The data highlights a significant reduction in loss rates post-2005, indicating improvements in luggage handling practices or management across various transportation modes.
