From 2004 to 2013, faculty satisfaction shows varied trends across different institutions. While some, like Meridian Academy and the Zenith Institute of Technology, exhibit substantial fluctuations before stabilizing, others, such as Celestial College and Silverhaven Polytechnic, maintain a more consistent level of satisfaction. The overall trend indicates growth with slight fluctuations around mid-period, especially from 2007 to 2010. The most significant growth is observed in the Borealis Graduate School, demonstrating a notable increase in satisfaction. Despite mid-period fluctuations, the overall trend is positive, suggesting generally improving faculty satisfaction across all schools by 2013.
