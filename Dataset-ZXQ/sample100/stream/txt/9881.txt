The on-time delivery rates from 2002 to 2020 display a generally stable trend with some fluctuations for all categories. E-Commerce Parcels and Automotive Parts maintained relatively higher levels of on-time deliveries compared to Oversized Loads and Same-Day Couriers. Notably, E-Commerce Parcels experienced a slight increase over the years, whereas Same-Day Couriers showed more variability. The most significant growth appears to occur in the E-Commerce Parcels category, especially after 2015. Overall, while there are fluctuations indicating specific periods of variability, the chart suggests steady improvement in logistics efficiency, particularly in the e-commerce sector.
