From 2002 to 2024, the alumni giving rate shows overall stability with periodic fluctuations. Despite minor variations, the giving rate does not exhibit a clear upward or downward trend, indicating a stable trend over time. Key observations include noticeable growth peaks around 2014 and gradual declines post-2018, possibly due to external factors or changes in donor engagement strategies. The highest increases in giving rates appear to coincide with major events or initiatives. Stability in the data suggests consistent alumni engagement, requiring targeted strategies to sustain or enhance contributions.
