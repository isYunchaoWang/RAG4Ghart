From 2011 to 2021, patent applications by Oracle Systems and Echo Dynamics showed an overall increasing trend with fluctuations. The total applications rose steadily, peaking in 2021. The increase was not linear, with a noticeable dip around 2016 and subsequent growth. Both companies contributed to this upward trend, with Echo Dynamics showing consistent expansion. The significant upward shift after 2017 indicates a period of accelerated growth, with a turning point likely occurring around that time, leading to the highest levels recorded by 2021.
