From 1976 to 1990, stadium attendance for the various events showed a fluctuating but overall stable trend. The data reveals that the maximum attendance occurred towards the later years, with a noticeable dip around the early 1980s. Despite these fluctuations, there was no significant long-term increase or decrease, indicating stability rather than growth or decline. Significant fluctuations were occasional and did not alter the overall balance much. Each segment maintained a relatively proportional distribution throughout the period, suggesting a consistent level of interest in the events covered.
