The Housing Affordability Index from 1997 to 2009 shows a generally stable trend with moderate fluctuations. While individual areas such as the Crimson Peaks and Azure Coast displayed slight variability, the overall index did not demonstrate significant increases or decreases by the end of the period. The trend retained a somewhat consistent shape with a few minor turning points around the early 2000s and mid-2000s. Each region had its own variations, but they mostly balanced each other out, leading to overall stability in housing affordability during this time frame.
