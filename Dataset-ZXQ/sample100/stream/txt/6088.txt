The Housing Affordability Index from 1987 to 2015 shows a fluctuating trend with periodic rises and falls across four regions: Sunstone Desert, Azure Coast, Veridian Plains, and Golden Delta. Over the years, the index experiences notable peaks and troughs, indicating periods of increased and decreased affordability. The index does not exhibit a clear linear trend, as it rises and falls multiple times, suggesting market volatility. Key peaks were observed around the early 2000s and post-2005, while significant declines are seen around the early 1990s and 2010. This pattern reflects significant economic events impacting housing affordability throughout the measured period.
