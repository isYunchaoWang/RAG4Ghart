The student-teacher ratios from 1950 to 1969 exhibit a largely fluctuating pattern across the institutions, with some notable variations. The data showcases periods of both increase and decrease but tends to maintain a somewhat stable average over the years. Aethelgard School of Arts consistently maintains a higher ratio, indicating a more substantial growth within the timeframe. Conversely, Zenith Institute of Technology shows periods of decrease, notably in the mid-1950s and mid-1960s, highlighting possible institutional changes. Generally, the trend is not linear, with several turning points reflecting shifts in educational policy or institutional capacity across these years.
