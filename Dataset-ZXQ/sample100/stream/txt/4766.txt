From 1975 to 2002, the average treatment cost for both emergency procedures and chronic care programs exhibited a gradual upward trend. Initially, there were some fluctuations, but the overall trajectory shows consistent growth, suggesting an increase in treatment costs over the period. Notably, the chronic care program costs expanded at a more noticeable rate compared to emergency procedures, contributing significantly to the overall rise. There were no sharp turning points indicating sudden changes; rather, the growth appeared relatively steady, indicating a sustained increase in healthcare expenditures during these years.
