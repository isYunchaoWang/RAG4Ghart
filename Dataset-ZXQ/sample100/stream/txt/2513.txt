The student-teacher ratio from 1966 to 1995 shows a generally stable trend with some fluctuations. The data indicates an overall decrease in the ratio over the years. The lowest ratios are observed in the early 1990s, representing an improvement in student-teacher ratios. The most significant growth in improved ratios occurs during the late 1980s to early 1990s. Each institution's ratios contribute to this overall pattern, with variations reflecting individual shifts but maintaining a steady downward trend in aggregate.
