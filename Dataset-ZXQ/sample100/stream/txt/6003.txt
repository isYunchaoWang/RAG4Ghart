The Housing Affordability Index from 1974 to 1998 displays an overall increasing trend, though with some fluctuations. Shadowfen and Silverwood Forest showed a decline over time, whereas the other regions, particularly Sunstone Desert, experienced growth. The most significant growth occurred in the mid-to-late 1990s, which marked a prominent turning point for regional affordability. Despite the different trends among regions, the collective trajectory indicates enhanced housing affordability towards the end of the period covered.
