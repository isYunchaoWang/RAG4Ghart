From 1951 to 1961, the chart shows vehicle maintenance costs remained relatively stable with some fluctuations. Maintenance costs generally exhibited a wave-like shape, suggesting periodic increases and decreases rather than linear growth. Notably, Diesel Fleets and Electric Trucks contributed significantly to the overall trend, with variations suggesting potential technological or market adjustments impacting maintenance costs. The data does not reveal dramatic shifts or turning points but rather a consistent pattern of minor fluctuations, indicating a steady maintenance cost trend for the vehicles assessed during this period.
