The data on food waste from 1971 to 2000 shows a generally stable trend with periodic fluctuations. The total waste remains relatively constant over the years, indicating no clear increasing or decreasing trajectory. The fluctuations are non-linear and exhibit peaks and troughs, reflecting changes in food waste levels across the given timeframe. Significant variations suggest potential turning points, but the overall spread of contributions from each company remains similar, maintaining a balanced distribution across years.
