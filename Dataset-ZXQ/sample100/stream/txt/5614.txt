From 1952 to 1978, home sales across Ironwood Market, Echo Trade, and Starfall Mart showed a cyclic pattern with multiple fluctuations over the years. Despite these fluctuations, an overall slightly increasing trend can be observed. Key turning points appear in the early 1960s and early 1970s with notable rises and subsequent dips, indicating periods of rapid growth followed by slight declines. Each market contributed differently to the overall sales volume, with each maintaining its proportion over the years, suggesting a stable competitive market environment.
