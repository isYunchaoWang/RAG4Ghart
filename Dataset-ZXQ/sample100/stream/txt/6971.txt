From 1994 to 2013, the overall trend in patent applications for Echo Dynamics, Luminara Solutions, and Nova Industries exhibited an increasing pattern with fluctuations. Echo Dynamics showed substantial growth, particularly after 2002, contributing significantly to the overall upward trend. Luminara Solutions maintained relatively stable growth throughout the period, while Nova Industries experienced more pronounced fluctuations, especially around 2002 and 2010. The period from 2009 onwards marked a notable rise in applications, particularly for Echo Dynamics, indicating potential strategic shifts or innovations during these years. Overall, while growth was not linear due to these fluctuations, the combined applications of all three companies increased over the two decades.
