From 1969 to 1991, the total food waste across the three networks¡ªTerraTrade Network, AgriFlow Solutions, and CropConnect Logistics¡ªexhibited a generally increasing trend. The data reveals cyclical fluctuations throughout the period, yet the overall trajectory suggests growth, particularly evident in the gradual rise of CropConnect Logistics' section. Although yearly fluctuations were noted, no significant turning points were identified. This consistent upward shift in food waste highlights the growing need for effective waste management strategies within these sectors over the two decades observed.
