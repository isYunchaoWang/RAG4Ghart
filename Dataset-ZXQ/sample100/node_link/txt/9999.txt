There are a total of 10 edges, which include various relation types such as air routes, intercity bus routes, logistics alliances, and shipping lanes. The graph is fully connected, meaning there are no isolated components. The most influential nodes, based on degree centrality, are Rotterdam Port, Dubai Transport Center, and Shanghai Freight Station, each playing a crucial role in the connectivity and efficiency of the transport network.
