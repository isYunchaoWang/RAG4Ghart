The graph of collaborative links depicts a fully connected network involving ten distinct research entities. These entities are interconnected through various relation types such as Co Authorship, Joint Labs, Patent Sharing, Research Funding, and Tech Transfer. There are no isolated components, indicating a high level of collaboration among all participants. The most influential nodes, based on their degree centrality, are the Institute of Robotics and AI, Climate Research Center, and Global Policy Institute, each serving as key hubs within this network. This structure underscores a robust system of inter-institutional collaboration, facilitating diverse forms of academic and technological exchanges.
