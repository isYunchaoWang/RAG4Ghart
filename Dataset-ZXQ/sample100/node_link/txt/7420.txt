The network consists of 10 nodes and 11 edges, indicating various collaborative links between research institutions. Nodes are connected through different relation types, such as co-authorship, joint labs, and patent sharing. The graph is partially connected with two disconnected components. One component includes the majority of nodes centered around the "Institute of Robotics and AI" and the "Climate Research Center," while the second component consists of the isolated "Energy Innovation Lab."

The graph's most influential nodes, based on degree centrality, are the "Institute of Robotics and AI," "Climate Research Center," and "Biomedical Research Institute." These nodes act as hubs¡ªfacilitating collaborations across multiple institutions. Overall, the network showcases a robust collaborative framework, although the disconnect with the "Energy Innovation Lab" suggests potential gaps for further integration.
