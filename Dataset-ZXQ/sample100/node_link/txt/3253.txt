The Energy Firms Collaboration Map consists of 11 nodes and 13 edges, with nodes categorized as various transportation stations. The graph is fully connected, implying that all nodes are part of a single network. Among these nodes, "Central Transit Station" emerges as the most influential hub with the highest degree centrality of 5. Following closely are "Oceanview Ferry Terminal" and "Skyport Air Station," each with a degree of 4. The network's integration through diverse relation types, such as Energy Transfer and Supply Contract, highlights a well-connected system with key transit stations playing crucial roles in the energy collaboration efforts.
