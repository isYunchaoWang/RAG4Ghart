It comprises a total of six nodes and eight edges, categorizing connections into four relation types: Department Collaboration, Employee Transfer, Project Allocation, and Training Partnership. The graph is fully connected, indicating that all departments are part of a single component, facilitating seamless interaction across units. The top three most influential nodes, based on degree centrality, are the Departments of Cybersecurity, Infrastructure, and Environmental Safety, each playing a critical role in the network's connectivity. This interconnected framework supports robust communication and collaboration across departments.
