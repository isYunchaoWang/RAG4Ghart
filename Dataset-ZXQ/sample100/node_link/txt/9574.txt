The transport network comprises five nodes connected by a total of ten edges, indicating a diverse set of transport routes, including air routes, highway connections, and shipping lanes, among others. The nodes are all interconnected, forming a fully connected graph with no isolated components. In terms of influence, the most connected hubs are the Chicago Logistics Hub, Singapore Distribution Node, and Shanghai Freight Station, each demonstrating high degree centrality. This suggests these hubs play a vital role in facilitating transport and logistics across the network. The efficient integration of various transport modes positions the network for effective global distribution and connectivity.
