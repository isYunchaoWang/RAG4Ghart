The transport network consists of 5 nodes interconnected by 10 edges, categorized into air routes, highway connections, logistics alliances, and railway lines. The network is fully connected, allowing for seamless interaction between all nodes without any isolated components. The most influential nodes, determined by their degree centrality, are the Chicago Logistics Hub, Dubai Transport Center, and Rotterdam Port, each having the highest connectivity in the network. This suggests that these nodes play a critical role in maintaining efficient and robust transport flows across the network.
