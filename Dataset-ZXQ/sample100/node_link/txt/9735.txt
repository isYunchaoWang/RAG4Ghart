The transport network consists of five nodes, each representing a major logistics location: Chicago Logistics Hub, Shanghai Freight Station, Dubai Transport Center, Singapore Distribution Node, and Rotterdam Port. These nodes are interconnected through ten edges of various relation types, including air routes, highway connections, intercity bus routes, railway lines, and shipping lanes. The graph is fully connected, indicating a robust inter-node connectivity with no isolated components. The most influential nodes, based on degree centrality, are the Dubai Transport Center, Singapore Distribution Node, and Shanghai Freight Station, each exhibiting the highest number of connections. This analysis underscores the strategic importance of these hubs in facilitating efficient global transport and logistics operations.
