The regional tourist flow network consists of 10 nodes and 13 edges, representing various well-known tourist landmarks interconnected by different types of tourism relations. The graph is disconnected, comprising three separate components: the main cluster linking European, North American, and Middle Eastern locations (7 nodes); a duo between Santorini Scenic Viewpoint and Beijing Forbidden Site (2 nodes); and a solitary link to Bali Beach Resort from the central group (1 node). Within the central component, Paris Historical Spot, Rome Ancient Ruins, and New York City Landmark are identified as the most influential hubs due to their high degree centrality with 5, 4, and 4 connections, respectively. These nodes significantly facilitate connectivity and potential tourist flow in the network.
