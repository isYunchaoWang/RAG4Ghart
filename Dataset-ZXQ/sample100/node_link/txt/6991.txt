The collaborative network between research labs and universities consists of 10 nodes with 12 connections of varying relation types including co-authorship, joint labs, patent sharing, research funding, and tech transfer. The network is mostly connected but forms two separate components: one large interconnected group of nine entities, and a single isolated node, the Neuroscience Research Group. Key hubs in the network based on degree centrality are the Climate Research Center, Institute of Robotics and AI, and Global Policy Institute, which play pivotal roles in fostering collaboration through multiple connections. This structure highlights the importance of these hubs in maintaining a cohesive research ecosystem.
