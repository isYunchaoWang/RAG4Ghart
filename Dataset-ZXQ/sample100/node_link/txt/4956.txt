The network representing employee transfers across departments consists of 6 nodes, each corresponding to a department, and 15 edges illustrating the various types of connections such as department collaboration, employee transfer, project allocation, and training partnerships. Upon analysis, the graph is fully connected, meaning all departments are part of a single, cohesive component with no isolated groups. The key influential nodes based on degree centrality are the Department of Human Resources, Department of Urban Planning, and Department of Cybersecurity, each playing a central role in maintaining strong interdepartmental connections. This structure highlights a robust and integrated network conducive to streamlined operations and collaboration across the organization.
