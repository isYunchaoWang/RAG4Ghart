The network of key stakeholders in global sports events comprises a total of 15 nodes and 14 edges, indicating various relationships such as broadcast rights, league affiliations, match schedules, ticket sharing, and venue bookings. The nodes are categorized into different types based on their specific roles, but the chart does not specify explicit node types for further categorization. The graph is largely connected with one disconnected node, the Nova Creative Taskforce, resulting in two separate components. The main component includes key teams such as the Alpha Research Team, Delta Innovation Crew, and Gamma Security Unit, serving as central hubs with the highest influence, having degrees of 4, 3, and 3 respectively. This central core facilitates most of the connectivity and interactions, playing a critical role in the network's functionality. The structure suggests a highly interlinked system where a few central nodes maintain a robust interconnection across the network, crucial for managing global sports events effectively.
