In the 2022 sports distribution by category, "Training Tech" encompasses the entire dataset at 100%. The largest category within this realm is "Force Analysis" at 83.69%, with a significant portion attributed to "Force Plates," "Piezoelectric," and "Calibration," each at 57.68%. The most notable subcategory under "Calibration" is "Nonlinearity Correction," claiming 34.28%. Conversely, "Motion Capture" represents the smallest category at 5.71%. 

The overall distribution indicates a heavy emphasis on force analysis technology, with biomechanics also contributing, though to a much lesser degree at 16.31%. This structure suggests a key focus on technologies that measure and analyze physical forces, with comparatively lesser emphasis on motion and gait-related technologies. There are no sharp growth shifts observable within the chart, implying a stable allocation favoring force measurement.
