The data shows a distinctive pattern of visitor attendance at the Ironwood Gallery from 1951 to 1965. Initially, in 1951, visitor numbers were high, reaching approximately 100,000. However, there was a rapid decrease over the next few years, hitting a minimum in 1955 at near zero. This declining trend continued with minimal fluctuations until 1961, after which a significant increase in visitors ensued. By 1965, attendance had surged back to similar levels observed at the beginning of the period, indicating a robust recovery in visitor growth. The most notable events within this timeframe are the sharp decrease between 1951 and 1955, and the strong resurgence from 1961 onwards, marking 1961 as a pivotal turning point towards recovery. Overall, the visitor trend displays a U-shaped pattern characterized by an initial decline followed by substantial growth and recovery.
