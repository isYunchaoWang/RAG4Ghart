From 1969 to 1988, publication trends across the five institutions vary significantly. Echo Research demonstrates a notable inverse 'U' shaped curve, indicating an initial increase in publication count until around 1981, where it peaks, followed by a decline afterward. Aether University experiences a steady decline in publications throughout the period with a slight uptick toward the end. Conversely, Nova Institute begins with low publication numbers but shows a consistent growth trajectory, especially pronounced post-1985. Oracle Labs and Crimson Foundation both have initially decreasing trends; however, they depict a revival and modest growth trajectory around the mid-1980s. Overall, these shifts highlight Echo Research's dominance in volume yet declining momentum, while Nova Institute gains substantial ground, suggesting a shift in research productivity and focus among these institutions.
