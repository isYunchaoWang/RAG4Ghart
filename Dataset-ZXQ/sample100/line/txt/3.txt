From 1986 to 1996, water usage trends across four establishments displayed varied patterns. Starfall Organics started with a usage of approximately 3.5 million cubic meters in 1986, peaked slightly before 1990, and experienced a gradual decrease over the next years, signifying a modest decline. Whispering Willows Estate consistently exhibited a downward trend throughout the period, starting from over 2 million to below 1.5 million cubic meters, indicating continuous water usage reduction. Riverbend Plantation showed a significant turnaround ¡ª it began with a reduction until around 1991 but transitioned to a robust increase post-1991, surpassing the initial figures by 1996. Ironwood Ranch maintained a stable, low level of water usage until the end of the period, with a slight rise observed towards 1996. Therefore, the data indicates overall mixed trends with Starfall Organics and Whispering Willows showing declines, Riverbend demonstrating notable growth after an initial decrease, and Ironwood Ranch remaining largely stable with minor growth in the last year.
