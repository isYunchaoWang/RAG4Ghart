The analysis of the average room prices for cruise ships from 1961 to 1979 reveals a pronounced U-shaped trend. Initially, there is a sharp decline from 1961 to the mid-1970s, reaching a minimum price during this period. The prices then stabilize, showing minimal fluctuation until a significant turning point in 1975, from which point a robust upward trend emerges, leading to a peak by 1979. This marks the highest growth rate observed following years of stability, indicating a regained market strength or increased demand for cruise ship accommodations towards the end of the decade.
