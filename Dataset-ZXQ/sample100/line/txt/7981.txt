The fan engagement data from 1977 to 1988 shows distinct patterns for Ironwood Fanatics and Shadowfen Devotees. The Ironwood Fanatics experienced an increasing trend from 1977 to 1980, reaching a peak in 1981, followed by a gradual decline in engagement until 1988. This growth was characterized by linear progression with slight fluctuations toward the peak and afterward during the decline. Conversely, the Shadowfen Devotees showed an initial decline from 1977 to 1979, dropping to negligible levels of engagement from 1980 to 1987 before a modest uptick in 1988. Key insights include the highest growth period for Ironwood Fanatics between 1979 and 1981, and the stabilization of Shadowfen Devotees' engagement at low indexes for a prolonged period before the slight rise at the end. The data reflects diverging engagement dynamics between the two groups over the period.
