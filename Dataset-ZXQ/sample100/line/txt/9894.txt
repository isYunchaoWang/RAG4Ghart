The analysis of fuel consumption trends from 1990 to 2008 reveals diverse trajectories across different transportation modes. Drone Swarms had a peak consumption of around 25 L/100km, with a relatively stable trend followed by a marked decrease post-2004. Freight Trains showed an initial decline, bottoming near 1998, and then fluctuating moderately, eventually reducing consumption towards 2008. Hybrid Fleets exhibited a gradual decline from approximately 7 L/100km to around 3 L/100km, showcasing a consistent efficiency improvement. Cargo Planes started with a consumption exceeding 15 L/100km, peaking before gently declining from the early 2000s onward. Delivery Vans unveiled a more variable pattern, reaching the highest consumption around 2000 before decreasing after 2004. Long-Haul Trucks displayed a similar undulating pattern, with notable consumption fluctuations peaking before gradually descending. Overall, while individual modes showed diverse patterns, there is a general trend towards improved fuel efficiency, particularly evident in Hybrid Fleets and Drone Swarms, reflecting potential advancements in technology and shifts in operational efficiency during the period.
