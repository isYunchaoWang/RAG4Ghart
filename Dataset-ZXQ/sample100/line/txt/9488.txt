The vehicle maintenance cost data from 1959 to 1968 reveals diverse trends across different categories. Cold Storage Vans maintain the highest cost, showing a consistent increase, indicating a stable linear growth trajectory. Aircraft Engines follow as the second highest, also on an upward trend but with slight fluctuations, hinting at a growth after a plateau phase around the middle of the timeline. In contrast, Heavy Machinery initially experiences an increase, peaking in 1961, followed by a noted decline with fluctuations, suggesting a downturn after the peak. Diesel Fleets exhibit a decreasing trend overall, yet stabilize towards the latter half of the period. Autonomous Drones display a unique pattern of overall growth after initial stability, especially significant post-1964, portraying a sharp incline signaling substantial growth. These insights highlight Cold Storage Vans and Autonomous Drones as key contributors to increased costs, while Diesel Fleet costs have been managed towards stabilization.
