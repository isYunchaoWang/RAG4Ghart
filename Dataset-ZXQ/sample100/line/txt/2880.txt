The chart displays a consistent downward trend in renewable energy production at the Sunstone Solar Farm from 1988 to 2002. The production begins at a peak of approximately 1.2 x 10^8 MWh in 1988 and continually declines to a low of around 0.2 x 10^8 MWh by 2002. This steady decrease suggests a near-linear reduction in production capacity over the period without any notable growth spurts or turning points, highlighting possible challenges or inefficiencies affecting this particular solar farm throughout the analyzed years.
