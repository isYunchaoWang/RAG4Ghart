The analysis of the vaccination rate from 1977 to 2003 across different sectors reveals varying trends. Azure Enclave and Stellar City Core maintained near-complete vaccination coverage throughout the period, demonstrating stable and high rates. District Alpha shows a declining trend, stabilizing at around 60-70% after an initial increase to almost 100%. Verdant Ward and Outer Rim Settlements experienced a U-shaped curve with a significant drop during the mid-1980s, followed by recovery towards the early 2000s. Sector Beta exhibited a drastic decline, reaching near-zero rates, indicating a significant negative change in vaccination coverage. Crimson Quarter showed a declining trend but stabilized at low levels after initially high rates. The significant turning points are evident in Sector Beta and Crimson Quarter, indicating key moments of reduction in vaccination rates. Overall, the data suggests both stable high coverage and concerning declines in certain sectors, pinpointing areas that require intervention to boost vaccination rates.
