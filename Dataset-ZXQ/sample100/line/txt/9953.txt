The data provided from 1962 to 1971 showcases an intriguing spectrum of on-time delivery rates across different delivery types. Emergency Shipments maintained a perfect record with a 100% on-time delivery rate, while Pharmaceuticals stayed just below this at around 99%. These delivery types exhibited remarkable consistency and stability throughout the entire period. Conversely, Refrigerated Transport displayed a clear, linear decline from approximately 50% to near 30%, and Same-Day Couriers followed a similar downward trajectory, decreasing from about 60% to near 40%. In striking contrast, E-commerce Parcels demonstrated a significant growth trend, beginning at around 50% and surging past 90% by 1971. This exponential growth exemplifies the highest rate of increase, marking e-commerce's ongoing enhancement in delivery efficiency. No significant turning points were detected in the data. Collectively, these trends reveal contrasting dynamics: stable superior performance in pharmaceuticals and emergency shipping, steady decline in refrigerated and same-day couriers, alongside robust growth in e-commerce delivery efficiency over the observed timeframe.
