Between 1985 and 2010, trends in patent applications across four companies¡ªLuminara Solutions, Echo Dynamics, Nova Industries, and Crimson Group¡ªexhibit distinct trajectories. Luminara Solutions shows a cyclical pattern with fluctuations peaking around 3,000 applications, demonstrating no clear long-term growth. Echo Dynamics, however, experiences steady linear growth, starting below 1,000 and reaching over 5,000 applications by the end of the observed period. Nova Industries begins with a gradual decline from 5,000 to complete cessation after 2000, maintaining zero applications thereafter. Meanwhile, Crimson Group starts with approximately 3,000 applications and shows an upward trajectory, eventually overtaking both Luminara and Nova by surpassing 2,000 applications post-2000. Key events include Nova Industries' significant drop to zero applications and Crimson Group's late-stage growth surge. Overall, Echo Dynamics emerges as a consistent leader in patent acquisitions, while Nova's cessation marks a notable downturn.
