The analysis of training hours from 2006 to 2017 indicates divergent trends between Human Resources and Research & Development departments. Human Resources experienced a consistent decrease in training hours per employee, starting from around 10 hours in 2006 to slightly above 4 hours in 2017. The overall trend shows a linear decline with no major turning points or fluctuations, signifying a reduction in emphasis on training over time. In contrast, Research & Development displayed a linear increase in training hours, beginning at approximately 13 hours in 2006 and reaching close to 18 hours by 2017. This upward trend suggests an increasing focus on enhancing employee skills in R&D functions. The trends illustrate strategic shifts in training prioritization across departments, with HR reducing its training commitments while R&D strengthens its focus in employee development.
