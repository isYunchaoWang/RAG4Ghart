From 1955 to 1976, the delivery times across different logistics methods exhibit distinct trends. Autonomous Vehicles show a consistent decline, reaching near-zero delivery time by the end of the period, suggesting technological advancements in automation and efficiency. Same-Day Services are stable, with minimal fluctuation, indicating a maintained efficiency without significant changes throughout the years. Standard Shipping experiences a notable rise in delivery time, peaking toward the end of the study period, indicative of potential decreased efficiency or increased demand overwhelming the service capabilities. In contrast, Rural Logistics started high but gradually decreased, reflecting possible investments in infrastructure and systemic improvements catering to rural areas. Express Couriers, after initial increases, progressively reduced delivery times, showing initial adaptation challenges followed by optimization over time. Therefore, Autonomous Vehicles and Express Couriers showed significant improvements, whereas Standard Shipping deteriorated in efficiency while Rural Logistics adjusted successfully over time.
