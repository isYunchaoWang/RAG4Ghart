The analysis of in-store foot traffic from 1975 to 1990 reveals differing trends among retail types. Home Essentials experienced substantial foot traffic growth from 1975 to the early 1980s, peaking in the mid-'80s before entering a gradual decline. In contrast, Fashion Boutiques saw a consistent increase in foot traffic, particularly after 1985, indicating a shift in consumer preferences. Outlet Centers and Neighborhood Stores both encountered a steady decline in visitor numbers throughout the period, suggesting either a shift away from traditional shopping experiences or increased competition from alternative retail formats. These trends highlight an evolution in retail dynamics, with Fashion Boutiques gaining popularity while traditional formats saw declining engagement.
