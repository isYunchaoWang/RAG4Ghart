From 1955 to 1974, the renewable energy sector saw varied growth among its components. The Verdant Biomass Facility exhibited a significant exponential increase, becoming the dominant energy producer by 1974, while the Stellar Wind Array experienced a slow but steady decline. The GeoThermal Bloom Plant showed moderate linear growth, contrasting with the Azure Tide Energy, which regressed slightly over the period. The most notable turning point was the Verdant Biomass Facility's accelerated growth overtaking other sources after initial fluctuations. Overall, this period was marked by growth primarily in biomass energy production, highlighting a shift towards Verdant Biomass as the leading contributor in renewable energy output.
