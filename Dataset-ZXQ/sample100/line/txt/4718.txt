The data on employee satisfaction from 1960 to 1989 reveals distinct trends among three groups: Management Team, Operations Staff, and Sales Team. The Sales Team consistently maintained maximum satisfaction, peaking quickly and remaining stable at approximately 100% from 1963 onwards. The Management Team and Operations Staff demonstrate an increase in satisfaction up to around 1975, peaking just under 95% before experiencing a decline. The Management Team's satisfaction dropped significantly after 1981 to below 70% by 1989, indicating a substantial downward trend. Meanwhile, the Operations Staff experienced fluctuations with peaks around 1975 and 1981 but ultimately followed a declining trend, albeit not as pronounced as that of the Management Team. The clear turning point for these two latter groups occurs post-1981, indicating a shift in satisfaction dynamics, possibly due to external or internal organizational changes. Overall, the significant drop in management and operations staff satisfaction metrics contrasts sharply with the stability in the Sales Team, highlighting underlying issues primarily affecting the former groups during this period.
