In the 2022 Tourism Distribution by Category chart, the highest category percentages are within Lodging Options and Hospitality Services, both at 43.33%. The lowest percentage is noted in Shopping Districts at 6%. The total distribution among these categories sums to 100%, with an average percentage of approximately 11.11% per category. The data does not indicate a linear increasing or decreasing trend since the distribution represents a snapshot breakdown rather than a temporal analysis. While there is a notable concentration in lodging and hospitality, no significant turning points are present as all categories make up the total distribution for a single year without evidence of growth rates or shifts. The distribution reflects a diversified allocation with strong leaning towards budget lodging and hospitality as primary tourism drivers in 2022.
