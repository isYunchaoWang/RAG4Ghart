In 2022, content creation dominated the social media distribution landscape, representing 55.71% of the total activity, followed by video platforms at 41.13%. Within video platforms, TikTok was the most significant contributor at 27.23%. Although content creation is the largest category, the diverse distribution among other categories, such as podcasting and social networks, indicates a non-linear, multi-faceted trend where growth and engagement appear diversified across various platforms. Noteworthy is the distinct presence of traditional audio formats like podcasting and streaming services, which together hold 24.12%. This diverse engagement suggests stable, complex user preferences with significant room for growth across newer content creation and interaction formats.
