In the 2020 energy distribution by category, industrial consumption emerges as the largest segment with 25.91%, while manufacturing and underground mining constitute the smallest contributions, at 6.97% and 6.45%, respectively. The average percentage across all categories is moderate. The overall trend in energy usage shows stability rather than significant growth or decline, with no sharp fluctuations apparent. Notably, industrial and mining sectors together contribute significantly to the total energy consumption, indicating a steady demand in these areas. There are no distinct turning points or sudden changes in the data, suggesting a relatively uniform distribution of energy consumption across the sectors.
