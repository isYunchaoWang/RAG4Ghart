The analysis of the transportation efficiency metrics reveals diverse trends across the different metrics analyzed. The route deviation rate shows significant variability, with "gas plane" experiencing a sharp decline and "chance Tram" showing a steep increase. The average speed indicates a progressive improvement in the "material plane," while "chance Tram" shows a slight decline. The maximum speed remains consistently high for "bit ship" but declines for "material plane." In terms of loading/unloading time, "open ship" and "material plane" display efficient performance with low values. Moving time sees "material plane" gradually increasing, suggesting ongoing enhancements in efficiency. Overall, "material plane" shows a consistent upward trend, indicating potential as an efficient transport option, while "gas plane" requires optimization due to its decreasing performance.
