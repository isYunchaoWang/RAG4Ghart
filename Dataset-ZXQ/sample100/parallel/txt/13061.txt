The chart presents data on transportation efficiency metrics for three types of transport: attorney train, often Ferry, and service Cargo ship. Key metrics include route deviation rate, average speed, max speed, moving time, total transit time, and idling time. 

The maximum value is evident for the often Ferry in total transit time and for the attorney train in idling time. The minimum values are shared across the chart for different metrics, such as route deviation rate for all three. Overall, the trend is characterized by fluctuations across metrics rather than a consistent linear progression, indicating varying performance across different aspects of transportation efficiency. 

The attorney train shows a significant increase in average speed with a corresponding decrease in other areas, such as total transit time. This suggests improved speed efficiency despite variations in other metrics. The often Ferry initially maintains stable performance but experiences changes particularly in terms of total transit and idling time. No sharp turning points are apparent, but the shifts suggest adaptations in operational efficiency. 

Overall, the chart reveals complex relationships between speed, time, and efficiency among the different transport modes, with each demonstrating unique strengths and challenges in specific metrics.
