The chart illustrates the characteristics of various property types. Throughout the data, the "field Cottage" consistently registers the highest and most stable values across categories, indicating a robust performance. Conversely, "training Cottage" shows significant fluctuations, particularly in energy efficiency and days on the market, suggesting instability. The "institution Mansion" maintains an unusual behavior pattern, displaying a steep drop in square footage but peaks in initial and terminal categories, hinting at variability with certain strengths. There is no clear linear trend across properties; rather, each type exhibits unique ups and downs with no significant turning points. Overall, the analysis emphasizes the need for further investigation into what factors contribute to the stability observed in specific property types.
