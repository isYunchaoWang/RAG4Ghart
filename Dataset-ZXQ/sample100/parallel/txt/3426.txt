The chart presents the productivity trends of three crops¡ªSoybean, Corn, and Rice¡ªacross different farming parameters: soil health index, equipment utilization, and water usage. Corn maintains a stable productivity level across the parameters. Soybean shows a slight increase, followed by a decline. Rice exhibits significant growth after an initial low phase. The most notable change is Rice's sharp rise as equipment utilization increases, indicating potential efficiency gains in its cultivation. There is a crossover point where Rice productivity surpasses Soybean and Corn, highlighting a turning point favoring Rice in conditions of high equipment use.
