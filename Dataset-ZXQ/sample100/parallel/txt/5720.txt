"Late Culture" shows a stark increase in the policy influence index, peaking with the highest values, but declines sharply in behavior change rate. "Physical Culture" starts with higher artistic references but decreases steadily across the other metrics. "Why Civilization" increases significantly towards the behavior change rate, suggesting a focus on impactful transformation. Overall, the data indicates that while "Late Culture" had the highest initial influence, "Why Civilization" captures substantial growth in terms of behavior change impact. Most dimensions exhibit fluctuating trends, signaling potential areas of strategic focus for maximizing cultural influence.
