The analysis of the research metrics from the three labs reveals distinct patterns in their performance. Mills and Sons Lab exhibits variability, peaking in lab efficiency and showing significant improvement in experiment success rate after an initial stabilization phase. Wright-Pitts Research Center shows a fluctuating trend with a high in lab efficiency but dropping in other metrics over time. Brown, Martin, and Carter Research Institute maintains a stable performance across all categories, reflecting consistent output. Overall, Mills and Sons Lab demonstrates the most dynamic growth in specific areas despite the fluctuation, while Brown, Martin, and Carter Research Institute displays steady performance throughout.
