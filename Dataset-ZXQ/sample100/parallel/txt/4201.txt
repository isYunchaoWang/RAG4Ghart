The analysis of HEIs performance reveals diverse trends across different metrics. Research funding shows a linear distribution, with significant investment from Howell-Hoffman Institute and minimal from Ingram, Melton and Ford School. The student-teacher ratio varies widely, indicating a lack of uniformity, with Ingram, Melton and Ford School having the lowest ratio. Alumni donation rates present a varied but generally downward trend, notably for Mckenzie PLC School. Test scores indicate relative stability and homogeneity across institutions, with a slight advantage for Barajas, Poole and Russell School. Significant growth is not observed in any particular area, but the data highlights varied strengths and potential focus areas for each institution to enhance performance.
