The research metrics for different labs show varied performance across collaboration index, experiment success rate, and lab efficiency. The Duffy Group demonstrates a linear increase across all metrics. The Grant, Edwards, and Thompson Lab remains stable, while the Moore, Rogers, and Harper Lab shows a significant decrease after an initial rise. The Maxwell-Johnson Lab starts high but declines across subsequent metrics. Finally, the Smith, Murphy, and Ford Lab shows mixed trends, peaking in the middle metric. This analysis indicates that while some labs maintain consistent performance, others exhibit significant variance in effectiveness across different research areas.
