In 2023, the income distribution by job level exhibits a balanced allocation across different categories, with Senior-Level professionals occupying the highest share at 27%, followed closely by Executives and Freelancers, each at 25%. Contractors and Entry-Level positions constitute smaller portions, with 12% and 11%, respectively. This distribution suggests a relatively equitable income spread, where higher-level positions command the majority of the total income share, reflecting the typical hierarchical income structure within organizations. The lack of a singular dominant category indicates a diverse and evenly distributed income structure.
