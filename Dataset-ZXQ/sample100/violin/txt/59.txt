The crop production data shows that oats have a higher production range with a maximum of approximately 12,000 kilograms per hectare and a minimum near 2,000 kilograms per hectare. Potatoes have a narrower range, with the maximum production just under 10,000 kilograms per hectare and a minimum slightly above 4,000 kilograms per hectare. The average production is higher for oats compared to potatoes. The trend exhibits a larger spread and variability for oats, indicating more fluctuation in production compared to the more stable production of potatoes. There are no distinct turning points or extreme variations that stand out, suggesting a generally consistent pattern in the production levels within each crop type.
