The chart displays the distribution of daily outpatient visits in various cities, with a notable variability from city to city. Elmhurst exhibits the highest maximum number of daily visits peaking around 2200, while Ironwood records the lowest numbers, centering around 800 to 1400. Despite these differences, the overall trend does not indicate a linear increase or decrease across the cities, suggesting that each city may be experiencing unique factors affecting outpatient visits. The data distributions hint at fluctuations within each location but are not indicative of significant growth turning points or consistent trends when evaluated collectively.
