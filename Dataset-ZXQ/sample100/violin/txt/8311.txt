The analysis of virtual housing prices by property type reveals a diverse range of price distributions. Farmhouses and luxury villas exhibit higher price variability with a broader interquartile range and more significant data spread, while cottages demonstrate the least variability with a tighter price range centered around lower median values. Townhouses display moderate variability with balanced pricing. Mansions, while similar in spread to luxury villas, have a slightly lower median price. Overall, price trends across the property types do not indicate a distinct increasing or decreasing pattern but rather varied stability depending on the housing category. There are no significant points of growth acceleration or turning points observed across the types.
