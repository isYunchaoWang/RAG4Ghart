The projected box office revenues for the movies "Lost Signal," "Nightfall," and "Last Ember" reveal distinct patterns. "Lost Signal" shows a median around 500 million USD with most projections falling between 300 and 700 million USD. "Nightfall" demonstrates lower revenue projections, with a median close to 400 million USD and a narrow interquartile range, indicating relatively stable expectations around this value. "Last Ember," however, stands out, as its revenue projections are highly variable, ranging from around 100 to nearly 900 million USD, with a median around 500 million USD. This variability suggests that "Last Ember" has the potential to outperform the others significantly, though it also carries more uncertainty. Overall, "Last Ember" indicates a potential for the highest growth among the three movies, but with a higher risk factor.
