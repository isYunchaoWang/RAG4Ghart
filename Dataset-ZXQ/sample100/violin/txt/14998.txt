The analysis of fruit transportation volumes across three cities reveals that Lakeview has the widest range of distribution, with volumes spanning from approximately 30,000 to 70,000 tons, and a median near 50,000 tons. In comparison, Ironwood shows a more concentrated distribution with volumes primarily between 35,000 and 65,000 tons and a median just above 50,000 tons. Zephyr, on the other hand, exhibits a slightly broader range than Ironwood, with volumes ranging from roughly 35,000 to 70,000 tons and a median close to Lakeview's. While the dataset suggests stable transportation levels with no pronounced growth trends or significant turning points, Lakeview stands out with a wider dispersion indicative of variability in its transportation volumes.
