The chart presents the tourism transit across five global hubs, with each segment reflecting both the originating and receiving tourist volumes. Jackfort and Brandonburgh exhibit the highest transit volumes, each surpassing 260 million tourists. In contrast, Ryanmouth sees the lowest figures, just above 130 million tourists, indicating lesser connectivity or popularity. Overall, the pattern indicates a stable transit system with slight variations among hubs. The distribution shapes suggest some fluctuations but no significant turning points or drastic growth rates. The interaction among hubs seems balanced, as no singular hub dominates the transit landscape.
