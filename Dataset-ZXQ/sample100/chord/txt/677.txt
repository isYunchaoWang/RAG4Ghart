The chart illustrates the transfer flow of crop production in thousand tons among four crops: wheat, corn, barley, and soybeans. Each crop shows different patterns of production and transfer. Soybeans have the maximum transfer value, while wheat displays the minimum. The total crop transfer indicates a balanced approach with diverse connections among the crops, maintaining a stable trend overall. Notably, there are significant exchanges between barley and the other crops, highlighting barley's central role in the transfer flow. There are no abrupt turning points observed, suggesting a consistent transfer pattern without significant disruptions.
