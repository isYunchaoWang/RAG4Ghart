The energy production and consumption flow chart indicates that nuclear power has the highest level of production at around 375 Gigawatt-hours, followed by hydropower and wind, both around 125-250 Gigawatt-hours. Biomass and geothermal have the lowest figures, each under 125 Gigawatt-hours. The distribution of energy is balanced, with no single source overwhelmingly dominant. The flows suggest a stable distribution pattern among different energy types, without significant fluctuations or turning points. The chart reflects a diversified energy profile, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a varied energy portfolio for sustained production.
