The chart illustrates the flow and distribution of energy among five types: oil, biomass, natural gas, coal, and geothermal. Natural gas shows the most significant activity, representing both high production and consumption. Oil and biomass have moderate exchanges, while coal and geothermal have relatively lower involvement. Overall, the data suggests a balanced energy distribution with natural gas as the prominent energy source.
