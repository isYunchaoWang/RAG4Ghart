The chart illustrates the transfer flow of crop production in thousands of tons among barley, sugarcane, and potatoes. Barley has the highest production flow, with a maximum value of 1,225 thousand tons, while sugarcane registers the lowest maximum at 735 thousand tons. The total flow across all three crops is significant, indicating robust production and distribution dynamics. The flow appears stable, without acute fluctuations or turning points, suggesting a consistent distribution pattern. No exaggerated growth or downturns are observed, reflecting a balanced approach in crop handling. Overall, the trend highlights an organized and steady transfer process in crop production.
