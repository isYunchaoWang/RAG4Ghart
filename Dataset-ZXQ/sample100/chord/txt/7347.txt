The HR department flow chart visualizes the distribution and transitions of employees among four distinct departments: Admin and Facilities, Operations, Human Resources, and Marketing. The Marketing Department shows the smallest allocation, with a maximum of 215 employees, while the Admin and Facilities Department displays the most significant capacity at 860. The overall employee flow indicates a stable transition between departments rather than sharp increases or declines, suggesting an equilibrium in employee distribution. The most notable transitions are from Operations to Admin and Facilities, indicating a strategic realignment within these departments. There are no abrupt turning points, suggesting a steady state in the department flows. This equilibrium aligns with organizational goals for balanced workforce management across departments.
