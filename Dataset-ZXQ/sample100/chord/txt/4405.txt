The energy production and consumption data show a significant reliance on nuclear power, with the highest value at 740 gigawatt-hours, while oil and wind have lower values, at 555 and 370 gigawatt-hours respectively. The overall trend suggests a preference for nuclear energy, followed by oil, with wind contributing the least. There are no significant turning points, but the data's flow indicates a stable distribution across the three energy types, with nuclear consistently leading in production and consumption.
