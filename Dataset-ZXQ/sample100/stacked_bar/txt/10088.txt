The analysis of R&D investment across different cities reveals that Northgate and Mapleton show the highest total investments, reaching around 140 and 130 billion USD, respectively. Conversely, Yorkton and Zephyr display the lowest investments, with values below 40 billion USD each. The overall trend in investments varies, with fluctuations seen among the cities, rather than an overall increase or decrease. There is no clear linear trend, as some cities have a balanced distribution between Biotech and Quantum zones, while others have significant differences. Significant growth is observed in Northgate, where the investment levels are the highest, indicating a possible peak in this data set. No apparent turning points are detected, showing several cities consistently invest high or low without sudden shifts. Overall, investment in Quantum technology tends to be consistently higher across most cities, suggesting a strategic focus on emerging technologies over traditional Biotech.
