The movie box office revenue analysis across the four towns¡ªSilverton, Meadowbrook, Fairview, and Riverton¡ªreveals that Fairview generated the highest total revenue, while Meadowbrook was the lowest. The data demonstrates an increasing trend, particularly where "Broken Mirror" has a pronounced impact, contributing significantly to Fairview's revenue. Although there are fluctuations, Riverton and Silverton show relatively stable revenue levels. "Shadow Line" had a consistent performance across towns but was less dominant compared to "Broken Mirror." Overall, Fairview stands out as a key market, highlighting its significance for future distribution strategies.
