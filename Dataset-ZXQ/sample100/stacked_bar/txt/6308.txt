The data on hospital visits from 2011 to 2019 shows a fluctuating trend with an overall increase in the number of visits. The highest number of visits occurs in 2018, while the lowest is in 2013. Overall, there is an observable rise in visits from the initial years, peaking significantly in 2018 before declining slightly in 2019. The most significant growth is noted between 2015 and 2018, indicating a rapid increase during this period. This suggests potential factors such as population growth or increased healthcare access contributing to heightened hospital visits.
