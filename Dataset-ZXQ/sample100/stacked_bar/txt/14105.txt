April represents the highest shipment volume at approximately 3000 tonnes, while May shows the lowest at around 1000 tonnes. The overall trend suggests fluctuating volumes without a clear upward or downward trajectory, indicating non-linear changes primarily due to varying volumes of commodities like textiles and electronics. The highest growth is observed between March and April, with a sharp increase suggesting significant factors impacting shipments during this period. Despite these fluctuations, there is no consistent pattern of growth, decline, or stability throughout the year.
