The data on hospital visits across multiple towns from 2011 to 2019 reveals significant fluctuations. The maximum number of visits occurred in 2017, while the minimum was recorded in 2018. Overall, the trend appears volatile with evident rises and drops, lacking a consistent linear pattern. The most substantial growth happened from 2014 to 2017, indicating a marked increase in visits during this period. However, the trend declined sharply in 2018, suggesting a potential turning point. Visits partially recovered in 2019, but still remained below the peak of 2017.
