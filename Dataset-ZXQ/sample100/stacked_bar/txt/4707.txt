The analysis of energy consumption across different cities reveals that Ashford recorded the highest total energy consumption while Pinehaven had the lowest. The overall trend across cities does not display a clear linear pattern but rather shows fluctuations, with certain cities consuming markedly more or less than others. Notable peaks in consumption can be seen in Ashford and Brookfield, suggesting significant energy demands in these areas. Conversely, Pinehaven and Ironwood have relatively lower consumption, indicating possible efficiency or reduced demand. This data suggests a need to explore the factors influencing the high consumption in certain cities and the potential for energy-saving measures in others.
