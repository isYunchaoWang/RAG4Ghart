The data on energy consumption across four cities shows that Ironwood has the highest consumption, reaching over 20,000 TWh, while Fairmont has the lowest with just under 15,000 TWh. The average consumption across all cities is approximately 17,500 TWh. The overall trend exhibits variability with no clear linear growth or decline, indicating stable consumption levels with slight fluctuations among the cities. Ironwood stands out for its significantly higher energy consumption, driven by a broad mix of energy sources. There are no stark turning points, but the distribution of various energy sources remains relatively consistent across the cities.
