The analysis of the monthly revenue figures for EcoCore, NovaEdge, and NextGen indicates significant variability throughout the year. The highest total revenue occurred in April, driven mainly by a surge in NovaEdge's figures. Conversely, October presented the lowest revenue, with all companies showing reduced contributions. The overall trend exhibits fluctuations rather than a consistent growth or decline, with notable peaks in May and April. A key turning point appears between March and April, where the revenue significantly increases. The data suggest a nonlinear pattern with periods of both growth and contraction across different intervals.
