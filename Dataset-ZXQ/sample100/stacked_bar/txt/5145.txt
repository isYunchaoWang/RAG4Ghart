From 2001 to 2020, the sales revenue in the food and beverage industry shows a noticeable downward trend. Initially peaking in 2001, sales decrease steadily over time. The yearly breakdown indicates a shape suggesting consistent declines, especially marked after 2005. This trend across bakery, dairy, and frozen categories lacks significant growth points, and no abrupt turning points significant enough to alter the overall trajectory were identified. Overall, the data reflects a consistent decrease, underscoring an industry-wide revenue contraction over these two decades.
