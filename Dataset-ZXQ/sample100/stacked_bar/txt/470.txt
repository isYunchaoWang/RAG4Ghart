The agricultural production data across different countries shows significant variability. Duurvale leads with the highest production, reaching nearly 500 thousand tonnes, while Yorkton records the lowest at roughly 300 thousand tonnes. The total production across all regions demonstrates a fluctuating trend rather than a consistent increase or decrease. The production in Duurvale and Crestion appears prominent due to the balanced contributions of rice, sugarcane, potato, and soybean. Meanwhile, soybeans contribute significantly to production in Northgate and Glenhaven. These findings suggest that while some countries like Duurvale excel across multiple agricultural products, others rely heavily on specific crops for their production volumes.
