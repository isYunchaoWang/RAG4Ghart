The monthly revenue data for different companies shows a fluctuating trend across the months analyzed, with notable peaks in March and June. March records the highest combined revenue, exceeding 1100 million USD, primarily driven by significant contributions from BrightEdge and EcoCore. Conversely, July reports the lowest total revenue, suggesting a downturn after the initial high in March and stabilizing through April. A resurgence in June mirrors the early peak, before slightly declining again in February. SkyBound and NovaEdge display relatively stable contributions throughout, whereas BrightEdge exhibits the most variability, indicating it might be a key factor in the overall trend fluctuations. The turning points in March and June suggest periods of growth owing to BrightEdge's substantial revenue impacts.
