Between 2002 and 2018, the sales revenue in the Food and Beverage Industry showed a notable increase. The data indicates that revenue rose from around 2000 million USD in 2002 to approximately 3500 million USD in 2018, demonstrating an overall upward trend. While there is a steady increase in most categories, growth is particularly prominent in the Frozen and Meat segments from 2013 to 2018. The trend appears as linear growth with some fluctuations early on, but stabilizing with consistent increases in later years. This growth reflects the industry's expanding market and increasing consumer demand over time.
