The data on hospital visits from 2010 to 2018 across Glenwood, Meadowbrook, and Lakewood shows fluctuating trends. Visit numbers peaked in 2014, reaching a maximum, with subsequent declines observed in 2015 and 2018. The overall trend appears non-linear, marked by growth interspersed with declines, particularly noticeable in 2013-2014, followed by a drop in 2015. Significant growth was noted in 2014 from the previous year, highlighting the highest year-on-year increase. While the years 2016 to 2018 showed relative stabilization at a lower level compared to the peak in 2014, the data suggests cyclical patterns rather than a consistent increase or decrease over time.
