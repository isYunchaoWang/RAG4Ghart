The data shows that corn has the highest production at 19,045 metric tons, while sugarcane is the lowest at 2,338 metric tons. The total production across all crops is 136,481 metric tons, with an average of approximately 11,373 metric tons per crop. The trend indicates a decreasing production quantity as we move from corn to sugarcane, with no significant turning points in the sequence. The production pattern smoothly declines without major fluctuations, suggesting a consistent reduction in quantities from leading to lesser-produced crops.
