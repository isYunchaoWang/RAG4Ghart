The data on hospital visits across five towns illustrates a varied distribution, with Silverton experiencing the highest number of visits at 340,678, and Fairview the lowest at 127,532. The total number of visits across all towns is 966,700, resulting in an average of 193,340 visits per town. Analyzing the trend, the visits do not follow a linear pattern but show significant variation, with Silverton markedly standing out. Meadowbrook also exhibits a high visit count at 185,977, although not as prominent as Silverton. There is a clear turning point and peak at Silverton's data, indicating a significant anomaly compared to the other towns. Overall, while some towns have relatively similar visit numbers, Silverton's data suggests a considerable deviation that warrants further examination.
