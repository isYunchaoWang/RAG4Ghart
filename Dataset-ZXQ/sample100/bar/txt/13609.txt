The analysis of annual visitors to various attractions shows that Coral Lookout records the highest attendance with 2,468.5 thousand visitors, while Dragon Ruins attracts the least with 318.0 thousand visitors. The total number of visitors across all attractions is substantial with a significant average that highlights the popularity of these locations.

The overall trend displays a gradual decrease in visitor numbers from the most to least popular attractions. The visualized trend appears non-linear and depicts more of a stepped decline rather than consistent growth or decline.

Notably, there are significant drops at various points, notably from Thunder Canyon to Maple Arbor, and from Willow Grove to Star Plateau, which could indicate key growth opportunities for less visited sites.

These insights suggest a diverse range of attractions with varying popularity, where strategic improvements at lower-ranked sites could potentially enhance overall visitor engagement and distribution.
