The data reflects a diverse production scale among various crops in the area, with apples achieving the highest production at 20,000 metric tons, while corn is the least produced at 2,397 metric tons. The total production is 126,716 metric tons, averaging 9,747.4 metric tons per crop category. Although there is a general declining trend from apple to corn, suggesting a decreasing production gradient, specific crops like sorghum and barley display notable deviations from the overall decline, indicating potential production peaks. This pattern emphasizes apples and cotton as leading crops, with steady high production levels compared to more moderate outputs from grains and oilseeds like rapeseed and corn.
