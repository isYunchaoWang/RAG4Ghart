The analysis of energy consumption in the given region reveals that biofuel dominates with a significant 3,584 TWh, more than quadruple the consumption of any other energy source. Gasoline follows as the second largest at 874 TWh. The consumption of the rest remains relatively stable and closely grouped, with natural gas at the lowest at 570 TWh. Biofuel's substantial usage indicates a potential shift towards more sustainable energy options, contrasting with the stable levels of traditional fuels like petroleum and coal. The data suggests a partial transition or investment in biofuel might be influencing energy strategy in the region.
