In contrast, Meadow Farm and Sunny Farm transported significantly less, with 817 and 1,091 tons respectively. The total transport volume across all farms is 9,614 tons, resulting in an average of approximately 2,404 tons per farm. The distribution shows a pronounced lean towards Berry and Harvest Farms, while Meadow and Sunny Farms contribute modestly.
