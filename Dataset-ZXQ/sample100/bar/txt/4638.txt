The data on energy consumption in the given region, measured in TWh, reveals that hydrogen and biomass are the highest consumed energy sources at 4,857 TWh and 4,817 TWh respectively. Geothermal and natural gas are at the lower end of the spectrum with 737 TWh and 563 TWh. The overall energy consumption is primarily concentrated in renewable sources such as hydrogen, biomass, and hydroelectric power, indicating a trend towards sustainable energy utilization. The broad distribution does not show significant fluctuations, suggesting a relatively stable consumption pattern across diverse energy types. However, the marked lower consumption of traditional sources like diesel suggests a declining reliance on non-renewable energy.
