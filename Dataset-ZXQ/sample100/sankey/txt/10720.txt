The Research and Development Ecosystem chart reveals a diverse distribution of projects across impact areas, research fields, research outcomes, and funding sources. Defense is the primary area with the highest project count, particularly in nanotechnology and space exploration. Significant funding is sourced from private investment, notably supporting prototypes, indicating a strong preference for applied research with potential commercial applications. The data suggests an ecosystem driven by practical outcomes, with a prominent inclination towards prototypes and published papers. Such a pattern highlights a balanced focus on both foundational research and its translation into tangible technologies.
