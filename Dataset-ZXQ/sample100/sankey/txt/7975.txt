In the Employee Management System flow, the data indicates the largest number of employees start from Document Verification, with a peak of 1,406 participants, whereas the lowest flow is from Orientation with 305 employees. The trend shows a decline as employees transition through stages, demonstrating a funnel effect. Notably, the transition from 'Full-time' employees to 'Performance Ratings' shows fluctuating engagement but remains the highest compared to 'Part-time' and 'Intern'. The transition rate identifies the greatest reduction from 'Excellent' to 'Phone Screen' interviews, indicating potential barriers affecting progression. These insights suggest that retention and advancement through the system could be improved by addressing key transition points.
