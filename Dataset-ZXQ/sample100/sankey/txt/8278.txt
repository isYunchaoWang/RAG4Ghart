In the real estate transaction ecosystem, commercial properties account for the highest activity with investors being the dominant buyer type, mainly utilizing cash purchases. The maximum transaction count is 403 for commercial properties, and the minimum is 52 for retirees using mortgages. The total transactions sum to 3181, averaging about 265 per flow. 

The overall high flow in the chart highlights a strong preference for cash purchases, notably by investors, indicating a stable trend towards cash over other financing options. A notable pattern occurs between first-time buyers and cash purchases, showing significant movement towards cash investments. There are clear turning points, such as retirees showing higher engagement with mortgages and the lease-to-own option being least favored across buyer types. This suggests a mixed trend with steady growth in direct cash investments while lease-to-own does not significantly impact the market landscape.
