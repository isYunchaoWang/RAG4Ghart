The Agricultural Value Chain (Crops) chart provides insights into the distribution, consumption, and processing stages. The storage stage has the highest value at 21,903, indicating a significant accumulation point in the chain. In contrast, food waste registers at 5,785, reflecting inefficiencies. Total distribution sums up across various categories, with storage dominating flow into consumption. Retail purchase and food preparation show balanced utilization rates, each with significant portions channeling into various processing methods like packaging and canning. Notably, grinding processes the highest figures post-consumption at 7,765. The flow indicates stable transformation from distribution to processing, with key points such as storage and grinding showing primary accumulations and transformations, signaling opportunities for efficiency improvements in minimizing waste and optimizing processing outputs.
