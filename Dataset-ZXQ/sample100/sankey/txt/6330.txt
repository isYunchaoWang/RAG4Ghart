Significant growth is evidenced in Pediatrics, despite a generally stable trend across other specialties. A turning point is noted with Dermatology, where child patients rise prominently from 1,035, indicating a potential demand shift. Overall, the ecosystem suggests a focused demand in Pediatrics, while other specialties maintain balanced yet moderate engagement.
