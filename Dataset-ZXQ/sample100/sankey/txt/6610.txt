The analysis of the Healthcare Service Ecosystem chart reveals distinct patient flow dynamics across providers, demographics, and specialties. The maximum flow is observed from healthcare providers to seniors (3,653 patients), and from seniors to dermatology (2,105 patients), indicating significant demand in these areas. Conversely, the smallest flow is from chronic patients to neurology (286 patients). Overall, the trend shows a higher concentration of seniors and dermatology needs, with fewer chronic patient-neurology interactions. There is no significant fluctuating growth pattern or turning point across categories, suggesting a stable flow trajectory primarily driven by senior-related needs in dermatology.
