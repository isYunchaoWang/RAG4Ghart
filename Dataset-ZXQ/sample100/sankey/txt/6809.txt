The analysis of the healthcare service ecosystem chart reveals that hospitals are associated with the highest number of deceased patients (1,357), indicating a significant patient volume or severity of cases handled. In contrast, nursing homes show the highest full recovery rate (483), suggesting effective recuperation practices. Clinics have comparatively moderate numbers across all outcomes. Overall, the data suggests a varied performance among healthcare providers, with hospitals managing more severe cases and nursing homes facilitating recoveries. There are no abrupt turning points, but the outcomes vary significantly across the different facilities.
