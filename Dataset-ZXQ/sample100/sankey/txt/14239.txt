The analysis of the Manufacturing Supply Transportation Chain reveals a complex network of flows with a clear pattern. Key metrics show a maximum flow of 593 units entering from the Auto Factory and a minimum flow of 19 units at the Retail level. The total distribution across all segments is substantial, with an average flow illustrating steady throughput. The overall trend demonstrates relative stability with fluctuations, primarily characterized by consistent flow divisions across different hubs and centers. A significant event is noted at the transition from the Auto Factory, which represents the highest volume and growth point within the network. There are no major turning points, as the flow smoothly progresses through the supply chain stages.
