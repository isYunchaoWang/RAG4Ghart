The agricultural value chain for crops shows diverse distribution across various stages from distribution through to consumption. Key metrics reveal a maximum flow in the processing phase of canning at 12,866 and a minimum at retail delivery of 1,192. The total across all phases sums up to a significant quantity, with an average value presenting a well-rounded spread. The overall trend indicates a substantial distribution of crops towards processing, particularly noted in canning and sorting. Both distribution and storage have noteworthy contributions, with the highest growth observed in sorting leading to higher volumes processed for food preparation. The chart does not reflect abrupt turning points but rather a consistent flow, ensuring a balanced transition through each stage. This balanced dispersal highlights the comprehensive nature of the agricultural value chain, with significant portions ultimately diverting to food waste and preparation efficiently.
