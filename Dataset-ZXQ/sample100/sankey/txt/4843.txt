The chart highlights the flow of carbon emissions across various sectors, with key figures showing significant variance in their contributions. The maximum carbon emission, observed in the Agricultural sector at 69,672 tons, contrasts with the minimum level in a specific Transportation method at 3,664 tons. The total carbon emissions amount to 692,065 tons, with an average value of approximately 49,433 tons per category.

Analyzing the overall trend, the carbon flow exhibits stability with modest fluctuations across different sectors and methods. The pattern can be characterized as relatively stable with slight variations rather than significant increases or decreases.

Significant findings include the highest emissions in the Agriculture and Road Freight sectors. Despite slight fluctuations, there is no pronounced turning point. The processes from various mitigation measures to emission sources display a balanced distribution without any abrupt changes.

This balanced dissemination of carbon emissions suggests areas for potential efficiency improvements and further mitigation measures to optimize overall emissions management.
