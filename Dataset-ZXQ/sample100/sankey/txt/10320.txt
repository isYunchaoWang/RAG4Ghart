The data illustrates the flow of research and development projects from various funding sources to different institution types. Private investment and federal grants are the dominant funding sources, displaying the highest contribution values of 86 and 85, respectively, as they flow significantly towards government agencies and non-profit organizations.

On average, funding amounts are moderate across sources, with the overall trend indicating a stable distribution of funds across diverse institutions. Notably, although crowdfunding provides a moderate contribution, it has multiple pathways and supports a balanced dispersal to startups and research universities. The data reflects a stable trend without any sharp peaks or declines, suggesting a consistent support mechanism across the ecosystem. There are no abrupt turning points, indicating a steady state of funding distribution across the research and development landscape.
