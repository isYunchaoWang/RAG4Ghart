The food production and consumption chain presents a diverse distribution network with various processing facilities supplying different consumption venues and further distribution channels. The data highlights "Homes" as the largest category, receiving a total of 63,869 units, whereas the smallest channel, "Farmers' Markets," handles 5,838 units. On average, most categories manage between 10,000 to 40,000 units. The trend shows stability in distribution, with no significant fluctuations or discernible linear growth. Significant events include the high volume of goods moving through "Wholesalers" (44,971 units) and "Retailers" (52,450 units), which are pivotal in linking processing facilities to food sources such as "Orchards" and "Greenhouses." Overall, the network is characterized by efficient routing from processing to final sources with substantial redistribution at central hubs.
