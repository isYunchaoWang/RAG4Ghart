The data visualization highlights the distribution of employees across different types and their corresponding performance ratings. Contractors represent the largest group, especially in the "Excellent" category, indicating a strong performance in this segment. Part-time employees are predominantly rated as "Average" or "Good," while full-time employees are mostly "Good." Interns account for the highest proportion in the "Below Average" category. This suggests that while contractors are excelling, intern performance may need improvement strategies. Overall, the distribution of performance ratings varies significantly across employee types, indicating differing performance dynamics within the organization.
