The data represents the distribution of three patient demographics¡ªChronic Patients, Pregnant Women, and Adults¡ªacross four treatment types: Preventive Care, Emergency Care, Therapy, and Medication. Chronic Patients exhibit the highest patient flow into Preventive Care, while the fewest are directed towards Medication. The largest allocation of Pregnant Women is towards Therapy, whereas relatively fewer seek Emergency Care. Adults predominantly utilize Medication, with a lesser emphasis on Preventive Care. The trend indicates a preference for Preventive Care and Therapy over Emergency Care and Medication among the demographics, suggesting a focus on long-term and rehabilitative treatments. Overall, Chronic Patients and Pregnant Women drive the demand for preventive interventions, reflecting strategic priorities in health service allocation.
