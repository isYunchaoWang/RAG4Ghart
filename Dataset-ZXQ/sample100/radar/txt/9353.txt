The radar chart illustrates the comparison of several key metrics within the real estate and housing market, with two separate data sets labeled as "mouth" and "stad." The "mouth" data set generally exhibits higher values across most categories, suggesting greater market volatility, capital appreciation, and price-to-income ratio compared to "stad." The trend shape indicates that the highest growth and variation occur in the Price Volatility Index and Yearly Price Growth Rate. The "stad" data set shows a more balanced profile, indicating potentially moderate growth and less volatility. Both data sets suggest key areas for targeted strategies in real estate investment and market stabilization.
