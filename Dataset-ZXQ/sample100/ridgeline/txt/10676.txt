The analysis of renewable energy share (%) indicates varying trends across different energy sources. Hydroelectric energy maintains a significant but decreasing share over time, showing a decline after its peak. Solar energy exhibits an overall increasing trend with some initial growth and subsequent stabilization. Biomass shows a fluctuating pattern, peaking mid-way before stabilizing. Geothermal energy experiences growth, peaking early, and then declines. Tidal energy maintains a relatively stable share with minimal fluctuations. Hybrid Systems show moderate growth with a peak followed by stabilization. Overall, the diversity in trends suggests a dynamic shift in energy preferences, with solar energy gaining more prominence over time.
