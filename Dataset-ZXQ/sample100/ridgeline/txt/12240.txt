The analysis of the Return on Investment (ROI) across different investment options reveals diverse performance. The stock market shows the highest potential return, peaking around 30%, with a gradual increasing trend followed by a slight decline. Peer-to-peer lending demonstrates variability with moderate maximum returns, largely stable with minor oscillations. Bonds indicate the least fluctuation, maintaining a linear and consistent trend with lower returns. Angel investments show a more dynamic trend with notable peaks and troughs, reflecting both high risk and reward. Real estate displays a stable trend similar to bonds but with slightly lower peak returns. Overall, each investment avenue presents a unique risk-return profile, with stock markets and angel investments offering higher returns but greater variability, while bonds and real estate provide steadier, lower returns.
