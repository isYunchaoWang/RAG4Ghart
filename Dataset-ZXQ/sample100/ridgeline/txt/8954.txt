The healthcare spending per person exhibits a diverse distribution across different categories. Surgical treatments show the highest peak in expenditure, indicating substantial investment in this area. Other categories such as mental health, pediatric care, preventive care, and chronic disease management follow suit with varying peaks. The distribution suggests that spending priorities may shift with time or among different sectors, as evidenced by various peaks and troughs in the data. Overall, the trend shows a fluctuating pattern rather than a consistent increase or decrease, suggesting dynamic allocations depending on immediate healthcare needs or policy changes.
