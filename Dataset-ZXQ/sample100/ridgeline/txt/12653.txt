The analysis of the Return on Investment (ROI) across different investment types reveals distinct patterns. Real estate investments exhibit a stable increase, peaking at the highest ROI, indicating a strong performance. Bonds demonstrate a relatively stable but modest growth, maintaining a consistent return. Angel investments show fluctuating returns with moderate peaks, suggesting more volatility. Venture capital displays significant growth potential but also the highest variability, highlighting high risk alongside high reward scenarios. Overall, real estate provides the most reliable ROI growth, whereas venture capital presents opportunities for substantial returns with increased risk.
