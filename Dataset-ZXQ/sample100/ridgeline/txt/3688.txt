The crop yield data reflects distinct patterns across different types. Rice reaches the highest yield, peaking sharply and then stabilizing. Potatoes show a significant mid-peak with a gentle decline, while Soybeans present a more stable distribution. Wheat and Oats have notable early peaks tapering off gradually, whereas Barley maintains a more consistent level throughout. Overall, the trend suggests variable growth depending on the crop, with Rice exhibiting the most dramatic rise and fall, and Barley showing the least fluctuation. This analysis highlights the diverse performance of each crop in terms of yield.
