The chart visualizes the share of renewable energy sources over a range of values. Tidal energy shows a fairly stable trend with slight fluctuations. Biomass exhibits a noticeable peak around the midpoint, indicating a short-term increase followed by a decrease. Hydroelectricity displays a significant rise and fall, suggesting a peak roughly aligned with that of biomass. Wind energy starts high, then decreases, showing a dip before leveling off. Overall, the combined share of renewable energy sources appears to undergo fluctuations with notable peaks and troughs, illustrating varying contributions of each energy type over the observed values.
