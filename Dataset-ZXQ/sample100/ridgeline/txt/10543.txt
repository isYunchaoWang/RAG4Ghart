The chart showcases the distribution of renewable energy sources as a share of total energy. Biomass maintains relatively stable growth with gradual increases, while geothermal and solar both present distinct peaks, indicating periods of significant growth followed by stabilization. Hydroelectric reveals a notable rise early on, followed by a decrease and then stabilization. The wind energy share demonstrates a steep climb initially, eventually plateauing. The overall trend suggests that renewable energy shares are increasing with varying degrees of fluctuation for each energy type, reflective of their respective growth patterns and maturation within the energy market.
