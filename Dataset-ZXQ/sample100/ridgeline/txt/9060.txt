The analysis of housing price fluctuations per square foot across Urban Redevelopment Areas, Rural Areas, and Suburbs indicates distinct trends over the observed period. The Urban Redevelopment Areas exhibit a steady increase with moderate fluctuations, maintaining relatively high prices compared to other regions. Rural Areas experience a consistent flow with minor peaks, reflecting stable pricing. The Suburbs show the most dramatic growth, characterized by a sharp incline to a peak before gradually declining. The overall trend suggests an increase in suburban interest, possibly driven by development or shifting preferences. No major turning points were observed; however, the significant shift in suburban pricing highlights a critical area for further exploration.
