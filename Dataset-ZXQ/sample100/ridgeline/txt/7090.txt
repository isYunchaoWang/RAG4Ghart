The freight volume across various transportation methods shows diverse trends. Barge transport starts with a peak followed by a consistent decline. In contrast, pipelines, rail freight, and container ships exhibit more stable patterns with slight fluctuations but no drastic changes. Cargo truck freight volume rises to a peak and then decreases, highlighting significant variability akin to barge transport. The most pronounced growth occurs early in the period for barge transport, while the other methods exhibit steadier, less volatile growth. Overall, despite individual variations, the trend lines suggest a mix of initial growth followed by stabilization or slight decline.
