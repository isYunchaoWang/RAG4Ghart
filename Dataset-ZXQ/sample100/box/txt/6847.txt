The box plot illustrates the distribution of daily outpatient visits across five cities: Oakridge, Elmhurst, Dunvale, Mapleton, and Ashford. Ashford exhibits the highest median number of visits, suggesting a relatively high and consistent patient influx compared to the other cities. Elmhurst follows with a similar pattern. Oakridge and Mapleton have comparable median values, indicating moderate patient traffic. Dunvale, however, shows the lowest median, with some extreme low outliers, indicating occasional drops in visits. There is no clear overall increasing or decreasing trend; rather, the cities show stable patterns with some variability. The insights imply that Ashford and Elmhurst may require more resources due to higher patient volumes, while Dunvale might investigate reasons for its lower attendance.
