The analysis of fruit transportation volume across the cities reveals a relatively stable trend across all locations. The maximum transportation volume peaks at around 225,000 tons, observed in Ironwood, while the minimum volume falls to approximately 25,000 tons, found in Rosewood. Springfield and Westport show slightly higher average volumes compared to other cities, suggesting these locations handle larger quantities more consistently. Mapleton, though it has smaller volumes on average, presents a more extensive range and notable outliers. Significant variations are evident, particularly with the presence of outliers in each city, but there is no distinct growing or declining trend overall. The data suggests that fluctuations occur due to specific anomalies rather than consistent growth or decline, with no clear turning points identified.
