The box plot displays daily energy consumption data across two cities, Springfield and Brookfield, measured in Megawatt-hours (MWh). Springfield's energy consumption shows a range approximately from 4400 MWh to 5800 MWh with a median around 5000 MWh, while Brookfield ranges roughly from 4500 MWh to 5400 MWh with a median slightly above 5000 MWh. Comparing the interquartile ranges, Springfield displays more variability than Brookfield, though both cities show potential outliers at the lower end. This indicates some fluctuation in daily energy use, but also a level of consistency around the midpoints, suggesting relatively stable energy consumption with occasional deviations.
