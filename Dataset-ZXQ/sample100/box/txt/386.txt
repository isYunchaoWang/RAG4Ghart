The crop production data for the region shows that jute has higher overall production compared to wheat, as indicated by the wider range of values and higher median in the box plot. Jute exhibits more variability and contains several higher outliers, suggesting occasional remarkably high yields. In contrast, wheat shows a more consistent production level with less variability and a tighter interquartile range. This analysis highlights that while jute production can be substantial, it is also more unpredictable compared to wheat.
