The Grocery category shows the highest sales with a median around 320 thousand USD and a notable upper outlier, signaling potential peaks in demand. Conversely, Movies have the lowest median sales at approximately 150 thousand USD, indicating a relatively stable but lower market performance. Jewelry and Music display moderate sales figures, with Jewelry having a median around 250 thousand USD and Music slightly higher. Overall, while Grocery seems to be a significant sales driver, Music shows consistent performance, and Movies lag behind. This analysis suggests that strategic focus on Grocery and Music could enhance revenue growth, while addressing the lower performance in Movies might require targeted initiatives.
