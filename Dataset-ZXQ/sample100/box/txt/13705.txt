The analysis of the number of one-day visitors to various attractions reveals a relatively consistent range across locations, with visitor numbers typically spanning from zero to just under 15,000. The attractions exhibit a similar median visitor count, indicating no significant outliers in general attendance trends. However, Maple Arbor and Golden Dunes show more scattered outliers, suggesting occasional spikes in visitors. Although there are minor fluctuations among the attractions, the overall pattern remains stable without pronounced upward or downward trends. This suggests that while visitor numbers vary slightly, they do so within a consistent range, offering predictability in managing tourist flows across these sites.
