Studios display the widest range and highest maximum price, with notable outliers, indicating potential spikes in demand or value. Co-ops maintain a moderate range with a slightly higher median price than Studios, but also exhibit outliers. Urban Lofts show the most consistent price range with a median comparable to Co-ops but less variability. Overall, the data suggests a stable trend with notable fluctuations primarily in Studio and Co-op prices, likely driven by demand surges or unique market conditions.
