The analysis of daily viewers across six video platforms reveals significant variations in audience size. FlowVid and Tubec are the leading platforms with some of the highest viewer counts, indicated by their upper quartile distributions and maximum values, although Tubec shows a larger range of viewership with a significant spread. In contrast, SceneX and MoviQ have noticeably lower viewers, as reflected in their smaller interquartile ranges and lower medians. There is no consistent upward or downward trend across the platforms; instead, viewer numbers fluctuate significantly. Notable spikes in viewers are visible on platforms like Zoomo and Videx, where occasional high values suggest periodic increases in audience engagement, bordering on outliers. Overall, the data indicate a competitive landscape with distinct platforms capturing distinct viewer segments, with FlowVid and Tubec emerging as key players based on their generally higher viewer counts.
