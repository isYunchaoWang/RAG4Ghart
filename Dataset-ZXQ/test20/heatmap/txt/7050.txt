The heatmap chart provides a comprehensive comparison of various disciplines within science and engineering across multiple categories. The key metrics reveal a maximum value of 0.97 and a minimum of 0.18. The total of all values indicates robust interactions amongst disciplines in categories such as Implementation and Publications. Across categories, the trend displays a gradual increase, with high levels evident in disciplines like Biomedical and Chemical engineering, particularly in Implementation and Patents. Significant growth is notably present in Implementation and Commercialization from Aerospace to Software, reaching peak values, suggesting that these are pivotal areas demanding attention. Conversely, Testing and Environmental sectors exhibit lower levels, highlighting potential areas for improvement. Such insights are essential for strategic planning and resource allocation in science and engineering fields.
