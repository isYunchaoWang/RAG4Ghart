The chart illustrates the production transfer flow of three crops: potatoes, soybeans, and corn, measured in thousand tons. Potatoes exhibit the highest production level, reaching up to 420 thousand tons, while soybeans have the lowest with around 210 thousand tons. The total flow among all crops is consistent, with averages indicating balanced distribution, though slightly favoring potatoes. The trend is largely stable without significant fluctuations, suggesting a steady state of crop transfer with no notable turning points or growth spikes. Overall, the distribution appears to facilitate an even flow, ensuring efficient utilization across crop types.
