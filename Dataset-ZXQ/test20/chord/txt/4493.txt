The chart illustrates the flow of energy production and consumption among four sources: nuclear, solar, biomass, and wind, measured in gigawatt-hours. Wind energy represents the maximum production, significantly contributing to the total energy. Conversely, solar energy has the minimum production. The average production across all sources indicates a balanced distribution with a notable reliance on wind. The chart's structure suggests stable energy flow trends with minor fluctuations between sources. However, wind energy shows a prominent increase compared to others, marking it as a crucial growth area. No abrupt turning points are evident, showcasing stable and consistent energy production and consumption patterns among the sources.
