The analysis of the transportation efficiency metrics reveals distinct patterns across the different transportation methods. The "also ship" and "another Tram" show an increasing trend in efficiency, with consistent growth across all metrics, particularly noticeable in route deviation rate. Conversely, "where plane" maintains stable efficiency across metrics, indicating a steady performance. "Without Cargo ship" and "street Tram" display a decreasing trend, suggesting potential inefficiencies, especially in average speed and moving time. "Seek Ferry" shows mixed results with initial growth in speed, followed by declines in the latter metrics. These insights suggest varied performance dynamics, highlighting areas for potential optimization or further investigation.
