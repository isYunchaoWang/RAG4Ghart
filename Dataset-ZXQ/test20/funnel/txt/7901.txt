The employee recruitment process is visualized as a funnel with the highest initial engagement at the "Job Posting Viewed" stage (100%), which narrows to "Offer Accepted" at 20%. This sequential decrease indicates a decreasing trend through each stage of the recruitment process. Significant drop-offs occur between consecutive stages, notably from "Application Submitted" (87%) to "Phone Screen" (73%) and from "HR Interview" (59%) to "Technical Interview" (45%). The most substantial reduction is observed between "Technical Interview" and "Offer Extended" (31%). The process demonstrates a typical funnel-shaped pattern with linear declines in engagement at each step, highlighting opportunities for improving conversion rates at critical stages.
