The real estate sales process follows a traditional funnel model, beginning with 352 properties listed, gradually narrowing to 60 sales closed. This indicates a significant drop-off at each stage, with particularly noticeable decreases between properties viewed (232) to negotiation (177) and from negotiation to contracts signed (112). The data suggest a linear decrease throughout the process, reflecting the challenges of converting initial interest into closed sales. No sharp turning points or sudden growth spurts are evident, underscoring the need for strategies to enhance conversion rates at key stages such as negotiations and contract signing.
