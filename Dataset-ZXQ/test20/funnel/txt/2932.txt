The funnel chart for Cultural Artwork Exhibitions (%) indicates a progressive narrowing at each stage of the process. Starting from 100% of artworks created, there is a consistent decrease as artworks progress through subsequent stages, reaching 19% for institutional acquisition. The largest drop occurs between artworks created (100%) and those submitted for review (74%), indicating the most significant attrition at the initial stage. The overall trend portrays a steady decline akin to a typical funnel shape without significant fluctuations or abrupt turning points. This suggests a linear contraction pattern, demonstrating the stringent selection processes encountered as artworks advance through the exhibition stages.
