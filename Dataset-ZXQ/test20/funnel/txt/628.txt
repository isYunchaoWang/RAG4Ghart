The Agricultural Supply Chain funnel illustrates a significant decrease in volume from the initial post-harvest stage to the final delivery to retail. Starting with 27,041 tons, there is a steady decline through each stage due to processing, quality inspection, and packaging, ultimately resulting in 4,127 tons delivered to retail. This represents an overall loss of over 80% of the initial supply, with the largest drop occurring between post-processing and quality inspection. The data suggests a process characterized by substantial material attrition at each stage, with the need for potential efficiency improvements in processing and inspection.
