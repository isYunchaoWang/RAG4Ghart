The Agricultural Supply Chain chart illustrates a sequential decrease in the tonnage of products as they move through the stages from initial quality inspection to consumer purchase. Starting with 10,952 tons filtered by quality inspection, the product volume decreases by about 50% to 5,476 tons packaged for distribution. This is followed by a notable reduction to 2,272 tons delivered to retail, and finally, 1,826 tons purchased by consumers. This funnel-like pattern indicates significant drop-offs at each stage, emphasizing the importance of efficiency and waste reduction throughout the supply chain process. The overall trend is a consistent decline in volume, highlighting areas for potential process optimization.
