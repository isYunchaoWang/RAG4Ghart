The tourist booking and travel funnel reveals a sequential decrease in tourist engagement at each step, with initial interest peaking at 2,410 thousand tourists selecting accommodation. This figure systematically decreases to 286 thousand tourists leaving reviews. The largest drop occurs from hotel check-in to leaving a review, indicating a significant drop-off in customer feedback participation. The progressive reduction in the funnel stages suggests potential areas for improvement in customer retention and engagement throughout the travel process.
