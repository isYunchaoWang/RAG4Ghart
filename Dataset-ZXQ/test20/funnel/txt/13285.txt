The tourist booking and travel funnel illustrates a significant drop-off at each stage of the process, beginning with 2,296 thousand tourists searching for travel packages and culminating in only 428 thousand leaving a review. The maximum value is at the initial stage, and the minimum is at the final stage. The overall trend reveals a consistent decrease in numbers as the process progresses. The decline follows a linear pattern with no significant turning points or fluctuations. The process exhibits the highest drop in numbers between the "Travel to Destination" and "Check-in at Hotel" stages, indicating a critical area for potential improvement to retain engagement.
