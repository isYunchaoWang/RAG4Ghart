The data on daily energy consumption across cities reveals significant variability. Fairmont exhibits the highest daily energy consumption, indicating significant demand, while Rosewood has the lowest, suggesting more conservative energy usage. The average consumption varies across the cities, with certain cities showing prominent fluctuations, as evidenced by the spread of their data points. Notably, Zephyr shows a consistently high range, highlighting potential growth or high demand. Overall, the trend across the cities does not suggest a uniform increase or decrease but rather varies distinctly by location. This variability highlights the need for tailored energy management strategies in each city.
