The crop production data for the region reveals significant variability across different crops. Sugarcane exhibits the highest production potential with values extending well beyond 10,000 kilograms per hectare, indicating it as a prominent crop in this region. Conversely, Flax displays comparatively lower production, with a distinctive outlier indicating variability or exceptional conditions. Most crops such as Corn, Cotton, Tea, and Tobacco maintain intermediate production ranges from approximately 2,000 to 6,000 kilograms per hectare. Sorghum shows a wide production range but flattens out beyond 8,000 kilograms per hectare, suggesting potential in optimal conditions. The data illustrate a stable trend without noticeable shifts or turning points across the crops, emphasizing consistent production levels relative to their maximum capacities.
