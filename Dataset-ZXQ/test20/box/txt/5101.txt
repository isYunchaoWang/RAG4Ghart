The analysis of the sales data in the food and beverage sectors reveals that coffee shops generally show a higher sales range compared to vegetarian restaurants. Coffee shops exhibit sales with a wider dispersion, reflected by a larger interquartile range and a higher maximum value, reaching up to 1400 million USD. In contrast, vegetarian restaurants display a smaller range, characterized by lower maximum values and consistent sales figures, though with some outliers indicating sporadic higher sales. Both sectors demonstrate stability within their respective ranges, with coffee shops achieving higher revenue potential overall.
