The box plot illustrates the distribution of one-day visitor numbers across three attractions: Spring Spa, Sun Harbor, and Hidden Valley. All attractions show a similar range of visitor counts with several outliers, indicating occasional high surges in visitor numbers. No significant increasing or decreasing trend is discernible from this static comparison. Instead, the data reflects consistent visitor numbers with occasional spikes likely due to specific events or factors not detailed here. Each attraction maintains a stable median visitor count while accommodating occasional peaks, suggesting effective capacity management for handling larger crowds sporadically.
