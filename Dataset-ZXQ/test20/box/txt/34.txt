The crop production data for barley and rye in the specified region reveals notable differences. Barley shows a wider range of production with high variability, indicated by the presence of multiple outliers around 10,000 kilograms per hectare. The median production of barley is higher than that of rye, with rye displaying a more concentrated range of values and fewer outliers. Overall, barley exhibits greater potential for high yield but with more variability, while rye production appears more consistent.
