The chart illustrates the relationship between innovation scores and commercial success in science and engineering projects, measured by project budget. Key metrics show the project with the highest budget at $5M, leading to the highest commercial success but not the highest innovation score. There is no clear linear trend, as projects with lower budgets also achieved high commercial success, albeit with varying innovation scores. The scatter pattern suggests that while larger budgets contribute to greater success, other factors influence the innovation outcome. There are no significant turning points but a notable high growth region where higher commercial success corresponds with moderate innovation scores.
