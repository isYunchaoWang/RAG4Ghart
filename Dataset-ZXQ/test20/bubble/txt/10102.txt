The chart illustrates the interaction between traffic volume and on-time rate, highlighting the varying ages of vehicles. Key metrics indicate the on-time rate ranges from approximately 78% to 90%, with a traffic volume from around 1000 to 9000 vehicles per hour. The data suggests a non-linear trend with fluctuations in both metrics, where higher traffic volumes do not consistently correlate with lower on-time rates. The analysis identifies notable variability in vehicle age, with younger vehicles performing similarly in on-time rates as older ones under varying traffic conditions. There are no clear turning points or consistent trends of growth or decline, suggesting a complex interplay between these variables without straightforward predictability.
