The data reveals a U-shaped relationship between the email open rate and the bounce rate. The bounce rate decreases significantly as the email open rate increases from 0% to approximately 25%, reaching a minimum around this point. Beyond this, the bounce rate begins to rise again as the email open rate continues to increase towards 50%. There are clear turning points at the extremes, indicating the lowest bounce rates occur when email open rates are moderate. This suggests an optimal open rate zone where bounce rates are minimized, highlighting the importance of targeting this range for efficient marketing and sales strategies.
