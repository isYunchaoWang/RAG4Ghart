The scatter plot comparing interest rates and rental yields in real estate and construction reveals a wide, dispersed pattern, indicating no clear linear correlation. The rental yield varies between approximately 2% and 10%, with no strong increasing or decreasing trend evident over the range of interest rates examined. The lack of a discernible pattern suggests that other factors may also influence rental yields beyond interest rates alone. Significant fluctuations highlight that the relationship between these variables is complex and potentially influenced by various market dynamics.
