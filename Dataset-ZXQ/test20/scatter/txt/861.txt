The scatter plot presents the relationship between school funding per student and college admission rates. The data is broadly dispersed, showing no clear linear trend between increased funding and higher admission rates. Admission rates fluctuate across various funding levels, suggesting other factors may influence college admissions. There is no evident consistent increase or decrease in college admissions as funding changes, indicating a complex relationship that warrants further investigation.
