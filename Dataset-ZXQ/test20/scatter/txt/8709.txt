The chart illustrates a U-shaped correlation between R&D investment and productivity growth. Initially, productivity growth decreases as investment increases, reaching a minimum point. Beyond this turning point, further R&D investment corresponds to a significant positive growth in productivity. This suggests that an optimal level of R&D investment is crucial, as initial increases may not immediately lead to improved productivity but are critical for achieving substantial growth later on.
