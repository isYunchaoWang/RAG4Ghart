The data on recovery time in sports related to athlete ages reveals a relatively stable trend with some fluctuations. The recovery time varied between 1 and 7 days. There is no strong linear increase or decrease, though a slight upward trend might be observed with increased age, suggesting that recovery times for older athletes may be slightly longer. The distribution is somewhat scattered with no distinct turning points, indicating variability in individual recovery experiences rather than clear age-related patterns.
