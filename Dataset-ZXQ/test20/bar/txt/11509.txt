The data indicates a varied number of video plays across different platforms, with Facebook showing the highest views at 1,877 thousand and TikTok the lowest at 358 thousand. The total plays across all platforms amount to 10,944 thousand, resulting in an average of approximately 1,216 thousand views per platform. The trend is not linear; high view counts are interspersed with significantly lower ones, suggesting no consistent growth pattern. A notable observation is the close competition between Facebook, Vimeo, and Twitch with all exceeding 1,700 thousand views, whereas TikTok and VK Video show markedly lower engagement. Such differences highlight specific platforms' varying audience reach and engagement levels.
