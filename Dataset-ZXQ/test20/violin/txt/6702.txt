The analysis of outpatient visits across four cities reveals that Ashford has the highest variability with numbers peaking near 2000 and a broad range down to 800. Northgate and Lakeview show more stable visit numbers around the mid-range of 1200 to 1800, while Highvale has a distinct lower range with a frequent visit number closer to 1000. The general trend across all cities indicates variability with no consistent increase or decrease in visits, and no major turning points are evident, suggesting relatively stable yet diverse visitation patterns.
