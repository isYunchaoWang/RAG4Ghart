In the real estate transaction ecosystem, commercial properties dominate the market, with a peak of 374 transactions through the neutral market and a significant 281 flowing into the buyer¡¯s market. The lowest figures are seen in single-family homes directed to the seller's market, with only 29 transactions. Overall, the data suggest a relatively stable distribution across various markets and buyer types. However, family buyers engage most with the neutral market, suggesting a central market condition. The most notable trend is the diverse engagement of retirees, indicating flexibility in their market participation. High growth potential exists in the intersection of property types with the neutral market, particularly among family buyers. The ecosystem reflects a complex yet balanced interplay of market conditions and buyer preferences.
