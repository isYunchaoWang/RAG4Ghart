The chart shows the flow of agricultural products across various stages of the value chain for crops, with Farming as the primary entry point and Distribution or Retail Delivery as the endpoints. The maximum value is observed in the Farming category with 12,075 units, while the minimum value is Fertilization with 849 units. The total units across all categories are 19,441, with an average of approximately 6,480. The overall trend indicates a significant flow from Farming to other stages, highlighting a branching effect, but doesn't suggest a linear increase or decrease. Storage and Retail Delivery both receive significant volumes, showing distributed final stages. There are no visible turning points, and the trend reflects a steady distribution process post-farming. This suggests that Farming is the most resource-intensive stage, with subsequent steps focusing on distribution and retail with balanced allocations.
