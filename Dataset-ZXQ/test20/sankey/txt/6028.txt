The chart illustrates the complex interplay between various healthcare service providers, patient demographics, and medical specialties, presenting data on patient outcomes within the healthcare service ecosystem. The key metric of improved condition shows the highest flow, particularly from nursing homes and clinics, indicating significant contributions to positive outcomes in these healthcare settings. Conversely, the deceased category remains notably lower, with major contributions from clinics and rehabilitation centers. Noteworthy is the full recovery category, indicating effective treatment pathways, especially in hospitals. The data reflect a generally stable trend with no significant fluctuations, suggesting efficacious patient management in most facilities. Major turning points include the substantial flow from orthopedics to full recovery, highlighting a specialization's success rate. Overall, the analysis underscores a well-structured system with particular strengths in improving patient conditions and advancing full recoveries.
