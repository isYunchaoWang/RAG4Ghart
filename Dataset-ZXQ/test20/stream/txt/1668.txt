From 1970 to 1994, museum visitor patterns showed a generally stable trend with periodic fluctuations across all museums. The Aethelgard Historical Archive consistently attracted the most visitors, particularly peaking in the early '80s and early '90s, contributing significantly to overall growth during these times. The Gallery of Whispers also experienced noticeable increases, especially in the late '80s to early '90s, indicating a possible trend shift or increased popularity. Collectively, these fluctuations suggest not just stable attendance, but also emerging interest in these museums, driven by either exhibitions or broader cultural trends during specific intervals.
