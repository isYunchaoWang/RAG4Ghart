From 1964 to 1993, water consumption trends among the Silverhaven Water Board, AquaFlow Utilities, and Borealis Water Cooperative exhibit a stable pattern with cyclical fluctuations rather than a continuous increase or decrease. The chart indicates a wave-like pattern of usage for each provider, suggesting periodic peaks and troughs consistent throughout the period. No significant growth spurts or turning points are evident that indicate a sustained increase or decrease in overall water consumption. The consumption appears balanced among the three utilities, maintaining consistent proportions over the years.
