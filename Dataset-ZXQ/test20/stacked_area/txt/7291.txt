From 1961 to 1975, the research grants awarded showed an overall increasing trend despite some fluctuations. The funding began at a lower level in 1961 and rose steadily, reaching its peak in 1972 before slightly declining in the following years. Significant growth is particularly noticeable in 1971 and 1972, marking a turning point with a substantial increase in research grants. This period can be characterized by consistent growth with some variability, indicative of expanding research investment across the institutions over time.
