The subscription revenue from 1959 to 1980 shows a robust upward trend. Starting from just over $1 billion in 1959, it consistently increased, reaching nearly $3 billion by 1980. This growth is steady but exhibits sharper increases post-1975, indicating accelerating gains. Each provider experienced growth, with particularly significant contributions from Starburst Online and Luminara. The consistent rise with a notable upsurge toward the end of the period reflects a successful expansion in the subscription services market.
