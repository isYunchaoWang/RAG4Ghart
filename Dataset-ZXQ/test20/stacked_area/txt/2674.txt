From 1977 to 2004, there was a clear upward trend in total carbon emissions, characterized by steady growth across all contributing sectors. The data reveals a consistent increase, predominantly driven by Zephyr Waste Solutions and Borealis Renewables, with the sharpest rise observed in the later years of the period. This suggests a potential acceleration in emissions growth after 2000, marking it as a significant turning point. The overall shape indicates exponential growth, emphasizing the increasing contributions from all sectors over time.
