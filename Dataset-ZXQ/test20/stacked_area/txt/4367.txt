From 1958 to 1983, the average treatment cost for both pediatric treatment and rehabilitation therapy demonstrated a consistent upward trajectory, indicating a clear increasing trend. The growth appeared exponential, with costs rising steadily over the years. Notably, from the early 1970s onward, there was a marked acceleration in growth, particularly in the late 1970s and early 1980s, showcasing the most significant increases during the entire period. This suggests potential changes in healthcare demands, inflation, or advancements in medical technology that contributed to these cost elevations. Overall, both treatment categories experienced substantial growth, leading to the highest average costs by 1983.
