From 1962 to 1978, there is a clear overall upward trend in patient visits across all four clinics, with a noticeable increase in visits towards the end of the period. The data exhibits a gradual increase initially, followed by sharper growth especially evident after 1974. While all clinics contribute to this growth, Aegis Medical Center and Meridian Health Post show the most significant increases. The total number of visits per month has increased markedly, reaching its peak in 1978. This upward trajectory suggests expanding healthcare demand and possibly improved healthcare services availability. There are no apparent turning points indicating a decline during the period analyzed.
