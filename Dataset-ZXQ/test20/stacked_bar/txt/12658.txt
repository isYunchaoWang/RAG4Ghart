The movie box office revenue across the six towns shows significant variation, with Hillcrest achieving the highest revenue, exceeding 500 million USD, followed by Eastwood and Oakvale, both surpassing 400 million USD. Glenwood generated the lowest revenue, just under 300 million USD. The overall trend does not follow a linear pattern, and each town displays unique revenue totals without a consistent increase or decrease across towns. The film "Plain Sight" consistently contributes significantly to revenues in each town. There is a notable peak in Hillcrest due to considerable contributions from both "Plain Sight" and "Hidden Truth."
